The aim of this research was to use the lens of insider-outsider or mutual social impact assessment approach to assess the social impacts of floodwater spreading project (FWSP) on the Gareh-Bygone plain, Iran. A survey methodology with systematic sampling techniques was used to select 138 households as insider group in four villages' of the Gareh-Bygone plain which is covered by FWSP. Furthermore, key person interview was used to assess the viewpoints of experts (outsider group) who had close, ongoing involvement with the project. Result indicated that the experts' viewpoints were more positive towards social impacts of the project. Whereas, the project had some negative and positive social impacts from the local people point of view. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Agriculture; Insider-outsider; Iran; Social impact assessment (SIA); Sustainability","Agriculture;

The purpose of this paper is, therefore, to identify the shortcomings in the Indian PPP procurement process using the key principles of sustainability. Design/methodology/approach: Qualitative research inquiry through grounded theory approach by using the literature and interview source was used to identify the challenges encountered in sustainable infrastructure development of PPP projects. These challenges were, first, reviewed from the perspectives of key sustainability principles and then discussed with the key stakeholders through focused interviews. Furthermore, micro-interlocutor analysis was carried to get an insight on the extent of consensus amongst the experts regarding these identified shortfalls. Findings: The key shortfalls identified from the study that adversely affect progress toward sustainable development include incomprehensive environmental impact assessment and social impact assessment studies; lack of stakeholder and local participation; high bidding and transaction cost; high user charges; improper risk allocation; lack of transparency and accountability; goal conflicts between public and private sector; and lack of skill and knowledge about sustainability. Practical implications: The study findings will help in devising appropriate strategies for enhancing the mechanisms, policies, and governance structure of PPP process in order to overcome these shortfalls and help in accomplishing the goals of sustainability while developing infrastructure even through PPP route. Originality/value: The paper presents different insights into PPP from sustainability perspective which has not been the focus of the current studies on PPPs. Sustainability assessment of PPP procurement is an area of research which is in a nascent stage. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Infrastructure development; Procurement process; Public-private partnerships;

The aim of a model for social impact assessment of public administration reform is to observe over time and mitigate the unwanted effects of public administration reforms on the groups of people, on communities and on society, as well as to encourage the positive elements of the impact. In short, social impact assessment of public administration reform can be used in order to minimize losses and maximize the benefits of the reform interventions upon small or large social groups.","Evaluation; Public administration; Reform; Romania; Social impact assessment","","","","","","","","Antonie R., Going Counter to the Facts in Program Evaluation.

Each county health department of a Midwest US state is required to conduct community needs assessments in order to identify health priorities to be the focus of prevention efforts. The problems identified in one county were ‘undiagnosed mental illness and suicide attempts among youth and older adults’. The health department established the mental health action team in 2005 to address the priority problem. This coalition is an interdisciplinary team with both private and public agencies represented. They meet once a month and engage in planning and implementing a variety of activities which include mental health awareness walks, depression screenings, trainings for health care professionals, community presentations about depression and suicide, Signs of Suicide and Lifesavers programs in middle and high schools, magazine and newspaper articles. Of these activities, a partnership with the local newspaper demonstrates an enduring effort toward reducing stigma, raising awareness about mental illness, offering information about services and information to improve the general well-being of community members. The team is responsible for a weekly column called ‘Living Well’. The newspaper readership spans beyond one county to 10 rural counties. This article explains the development of this media partnership, the challenges and benefits of writing weekly articles and offers an outline for the development of this type of partnership in other locations. © 2009 eContent Management Pty Ltd.","Bowen basin; Coal mining; Social impact assessment","","","","","","","","Barney L., Griffiths K., Jorm A., Christensen H., Stigma about depression and its impact on help-seeking intentions, Australian and New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry, 40, 1, pp. 51-54, (2006); Dunion L., Gordon L., Tackling the attitude problem.

However, how circular transitions in cities impact people has been rarely researched, and even less attention has been paid to the negative consequences of CE transitions. This paper presents the findings from a social impact assessment conducted in the city of Umeå, Sweden. We identified several negative impacts of a CE transition across seven social impact categories and explored three areas in depth with stakeholders in the city: employment, access to services and participation. We found that the negative impacts of the CE are perceived to be limited and that the CE interventions are mainly viewed as a win-win-win outcome, i.e., a win for the environment, the economy and people. This raises questions about the level to which societal consequences have been considered and whether all relevant stakeholders, in particular civil society, have participated in the design of the city's CE strategy. Our findings can inform other cities about possible negative consequences of CE transitions and provide insights into how to incorporate different stakeholders in the CE transition process to ensure that no one is left behind. © 2022","Circular economy; Employment conditions; Intersectionality; Participation; Urban transitions","Climate change; Climate models; Economic and social effects; 'current; Circular economy; Economic models; Employment conditions; Intersectionality; Participation; Policy makers; Recovery strategies; Recycling strategy; Urban transition; Environmental impact","","","","","VINNOVA, (2019-03237)","This work was funded by Vinnova under grant [ 2019-03237 ].","Aguilar-Hernandez G.A., Dias Rodrigues J.F., Tukker A., Macroeconomic, social and environmental impacts of a circular economy up to 2050: a meta-analysis of prospective studies, J.

To date, most social impact studies measure a single instance of residents' tourism social impact perceptions. However, the literature reveals that residents' perceptions might change over time, and therefore a panel data measurement approach is suggested. It was the purpose of this study to use panel data to measure (over 3 years) the social impact perceptions of residents in the impoverished city of Kimberley in South Africa towards the annual Kimberley Diamond Cup skateboarding event. In total, 1,039 questionnaires were collected over 3 years using stratified sampling. Four factors were revealed: city development, negative impacts, community upliftment, and increased tourism activity. When examining social impact perception trends, a general decline was observed in the positive perceptions, while the negative perceptions remained unchanged. This reveals that the event is not contributing towards positive social impact perceptions as in the beginning, and it did not improve adverse social impact perceptions. This study contributes towards the strategic planning and management of more sustainable sports events through multiple interval social impact measurements. © 2019 Cognizant, LLC.","Community; Developing country; Multiple interval; Social impact; Sports events; Tourism","","","","","","","","Archer B., Cooper C., Ruhanen L., The positive and negative impacts of tourism, Global tourism, pp. 79-102, (2005); Atenico M., Beal B., Wilson C., The distinction of risk: Urban skateboarding, street habitus and the construction of hierarchical gender relations, Quality Research in Sport and Exercise, 1, 1, pp. 3-20, (2009); Beal B., Disqualifying the official: An exploration of social resistance through the subculture of skateboarding, Sociology of Sport Journal, 12, 3, pp. 267-363, (1996); Binns T., Nel E., Tourism as a local development strategy in South Africa, The Geographical Journal, 168, 3, pp. 235-247, (2002); Bolger N., Laurenceau J.P., Intensive longitudinal methods, (2013); Bowdin G., Allen J., O'Toole W., Harris R., McDonnell I., Events management, (2011); Northern Cape ideal for extreme sports, (2016); Brayton S., Black-lash: Revisiting the 'White Negro' through skateboarding, Sociology of Sport Journal, 22, 3, pp. 356-372, (2005); Burnett C., Building social capital through an 'Active Community Club, International Journal for the Sociology of Sport, 41, 3-4, pp. 283-294, (2006); Butler R.W., The concept of a tourist area cycle of evolution: Implications for management of resources, Canadian Geographer, 24, pp. 5-12, (1980); Catlin J., Jones R., Whale shark tourism at Ningaloo Marine Park: A longitudinal study of wildlife tourism, Tourism Management, 31, 3, pp. 386-394, (2010); Clark L.A., Watson D., Constructing validity: Basic issues in objective scale development, Psychological Assessment, 7, 3, pp. 309-319, (1995); Daniel W.W., Biostatistics: A foundation for analysis in the health sciences, (1999); Deery M., Jago L., Fredline L., Rethinking social impacts of tourism research: A new research agenda, Tourism Management, 33, 1, pp. 64-73, (2012); Doxey G.V., A causation theory of visitor-resident irritants: Methodology and research inferences, Proceeding of the 6th annual Travel and Tourism Research Associations, (1975); Field A., Designing a questionnaire, (2003); Field A.P., Discovering statistics using SPSS, (2005); Florek M., Breitbarth T., Conejo F., Mega Event = mega impact?

Unfortunately, despite global frameworks, there is no one established standard against which to evaluate the social dimension. Thus, current social reporting is often disparagingly described as a public relations exercise with limited accountability, consistency or comparability. This article outlines the development of a generic TBL social impact framework and questionnaire designed to quantify an organisation's social impact. Based on valid preexisting measures appropriate for organisations in the industrialised world, the proposed framework and questionnaire offers a comparable and objective social impact assessment tool for organisations. The aim is to prompt informed debate and discussion about current organisational social impact reporting, whilst providing organisations with a tool which enables the identification, quantification and comparability of social impact reporting.

The failure to communicate perceived risks results from a two-communities divide based on both epistemological differences and obfuscation due to vernacular communication. The analysis provides robust modeling variables that can bridge this social-environmental divide. The case involves data collected from members of traditional communities regarding their perceptions of the potential impacts of proposed Marine Protected Areas (MPAs). The study is situated in the Bahamas where the government has approved setting aside 30 No-take MPAs to protect their sea. This analysis is based on 572 interviews conducted during eight field trips with members of six traditional settlements in the Exuma Islands and Cays in the central Bahamas. Confidence in the findings is high because the sample involves 34% of the census population of these settlements and the findings have repeatedly been returned for review and approval by the members of these settlements.","Marine protected areas; Risk communication; Social impact assessment; Traditional communities of Bahamas","Environmental impact assessments; Failure analysis; Mathematical models; Public policy; Social aspects; Marine protected areas; Risk communication; Social impact assessment; Traditional communities of Bahamas; Risk management","","","","","American Museum of Natural History, AMNH","We thank the Bahama Department of Fisheries for approving this research, and the people of the Exumas Islands and Cays for their participation.

This is because of the preference among many investors for simple and ostensibly robust and comparative metrics. Social return on investment (SROI), which produces a monetised value for social impact generated per unit of currency invested, has emerged as one of the dominant tools to generate such metrics. This article discusses the merits of this increasing orientation towards quantitative metrics in social accounting using SROI as an exemplar and drawing on an extensive review of social impact evaluations in microfinance. The microfinance sector represents an interesting and relevant case for social accounting because it has been strongly orientated towards quantitative and experimental methods to evaluate its non-financial performance. The article concludes that, despite using sophisticated methods, the microfinance sector struggles to credibly determine its impact on customers. Self- and microfinance institution selection biases cast doubts on the merits of using national benchmark indicators or control groups. Consequently, it is argued that SROI is better viewed as a means of claiming symbolic legitimacy (as per [Luke, Belinda, Jo Barraket, and Robyn Eversole. 2013. “Measurement as Legitimacy Versus Legitimacy of Measures: Performance Evaluation of Social Enterprise.” Qualitative Research in Accounting & Management 10 (3/4): 234–258. doi:10.1108/QRAM-08-2012-0034]) than as a robust method for evidencing social impact or a tool for managers and investors. © 2016 Centre for Social and Environmental Accounting Research.","microfinance; Social accounting and auditing; social impact reporting; social return on investment","","","","","","","","Amin R., Ahmed A.U., Chowdhury J., Ahmed M., Poor Women’s Participation in Income-Generating Projects and their Fertility Regulation in Rural Bangladesh: Evidence from a Recent Survey, World Development, 22, 4, pp. 555-565, (1994); Angelucci M., Karlan D., Zinman J., Microcredit Impacts: Evidence from a Randomized Microcredit Program Placement Experiment by Compartamos Banco, American Economic Journal: Applied Economics, 7, 1, pp. 151-182, (2015); Arvidson M., Lyon F., McKay S., Moro D., (2010); Attanasio O., Augsburg B., De Haas R., Fitzsimons E., Harmgart H., The Impacts of Microfinance: Evidence from Joint-Liability Lending in Mongolia, American Economic Journal: Applied Economics, 7, 1, pp. 90-122, (2015); Augsburg B., De Haas R., Harmgart H., Meghir C., The Impacts of Microcredit: Evidence from Bosnia and Herzegovina, American Economic Journal: Applied Economics, 7, 1, pp. 183-203, (2015); Banerjee A., Duflo E., Glennerster R., Kinnan C., The Miracle of Microfinance?

Beyond financial performance, microfinance institutions are to be assessed with regard to their social impact. Based on a comprehensive data collection campaign on 15 Bulgarian agricultural credit cooperatives (ACCs), we compiled a database uniting financial (perennial data from 2000 to 2009) and social performance indicators (2009). The social performance assessment follows an internationally renowned methodology of social auditing. It provides the database for the construction of a social output, which, apart from outreach, evaluates social network quality, client benefits (protection from over-indebtedness) and other items that have not been assessed in efficiency analysis before. We develop a new analytical model for Data Envelopment Analysis and gain meaningful results for the sample of ACCs. Interestingly, the efficiency rankings revealed that only ACCs with sound financial performance can achieve a higher ranking in the specification including the social output. © 2015 Operational Research Society Ltd.

Long-distance commuting: A new approach to mining in Australia. The Geographical Journal, 159(3), 281-290]. Townships and communities went hand in hand with mining development. However, in the past 30 years mining companies have moved progressively to an expeditionary strategy for natural resources extraction - operating a continuous production cycle of 12 hour shifts - increasingly reliant on non-resident, fly-in, fly-out or drive-in, drive-out (FIFO/DIDO) workers who typically work block rosters, reside in work camps adjacent to existing communities and travel large distances from their homes. This paper presents the key findings of our survey into the social impacts of this kind of mining development in Qld. Based on the results we argue that the social license to develop new mining projects is strong for projects requiring a 25% or less non-resident workforce, diminishes significantly thereafter and is very weak for projects planning to recruit a non-resident workforce in excess of 75%. This finding is significant because there are at least 67 new mining projects worth around $50 billion undergoing social impact assessment in Queensland, and many it appears are planning to hire significant proportions of non-resident workers. The paper concludes that this is a growing social justice issue requiring Australian Government leadership in formulating a consistent national policy framework for guiding sustainable mining development into the next millennium. © eContent Management Pty Ltd.","Online survey methods; Resource boom; Rural communities; Social impact; Social licence","","","","","","","","Towns of the Mineral Boom (Cat.

This paper maps the mental health impacts on a farming community in the Clarence-Moreton coal basin, QLD, after a minerals development proposal was announced. Methods: An exploratory study was conducted using an interpretive approach based on semi-structured interviews within a case study design. Results: A thematic account of existing and anticipated mental health impacts of minerals development on this community has two primary themes: Psychological stress experienced by the farmers; and tensions within the community. Conclusions: In addition to the long-term and increasing pressures on Australian farmers and a developing knowledge of the mental health risks they face, this study reveals a comparatively new source of psychological stress - the impacts from the announcement of a mining development proposal. The pre-development impacts that occurred in the Felton Valley resemble those known to occur with the announcement of large scale developments. There is opportunity therefore for such impacts to be anticipated, prepared for and resources set aside, with which to assist communities and individuals whose lives are adversely affected. © Copyright eContent Management Pty Ltd.","Australia; Farmers; Mental health; Mining; Queensland; Rural communities; Rural health; Social impact assessment; Suicide","","","","","","","","4817.0.55.001 - Information Paper: Use of the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale in ABS Health Surveys, Australia, 2007-08, (2012); Addis M.E., Mahalik J.R., Men, masculinity, and the contexts of help seeking, American Psychologist, 58, 1, pp. 5-14, (2003); Rural, Regional and Remote Health: Indicators of Health Status and Determinants of Health, (2008); Australia's Health 2010, (2010); A Snapshot of Men's Health in Regional and Remote Australia, (2010); Health Priority Areas, (2011); Albrecht G., Chronic environmental change: Emerging 'psychoterratic' syndromes, Climate Change and Human Wellbeing: Global Challenges and Opportunities, pp. 43-56, (2011); Albrecht G., Sartore G., Connor L., Higgenbotham N., Freeman S., Kelly B., Pollard G., Solastalgia: The distress caused by environmental change, Australasian Psychiatry, 15, SUPPL. 1, (2007); Alston M., Socio-cultural factors and family farming, A Legacy under Threat?

This paper aims to understand the contextual factors causing this rise in the practice, specifically within this sector; the mechanisms that enable it to be effectively implemented within an individual organisation and the outcomes of successful implementation for individual organisations and more widely across the sector and beyond. Design/methodology/approach: A realist theory-based approach is applied to the study of a small number of social housing organisations and leaders within the sector to explore the use of social impact measurement. The paper addresses three questions: Why is social impact measurement being adopted in this sector? How is it successfully implemented? And what happens (outcomes) when it is successfully implemented? Addressing these questions necessitates deeper insight into the contextual pressures that have brought to the fore social impact measurement within the sector and the beneficial outcomes the practice provides (or is anticipated to provide) to social housing providers. The methodological approach of Realist Evaluation (Pawson and Tilley, 1997, 2004) is used to structure and analyse the empirical data and findings into a programme theory for social impact measurement. Realist Evaluation provides a programme theory perspective, seeking to answer the question “what works, for whom and in what circumstances?”. In this research, the “whom” refers to English social housing providers and the circumstances are the contextual conditions experienced by the sector over the past decade. The programme theory aims to set out the links between the contextual drivers for social impact measurement, the mechanisms that bring about its implementation and the outcomes that occur as a result. Within this, greater detail on the implementation perspective is provided by developing an implementation theory using a Theory of Change approach (Connell et al., 1995; Fulbright-Anderson et al., 1998). The implementation theory is then embedded within the wider programme theory so as to bring the two elements together, thereby creating a refinement of the overall theory for social impact measurement. In turn, this paper demonstrates its importance (the outcomes that it can achieve for organisations and the sector) and how it can effectively be implemented to bring about those outcomes. Findings: Social housing providers use social impact measurement both internally, to determine their organisational priorities and externally, to demonstrate their value to local and national governments and cross-sector partners then to shape and influence resource allocation. The practice itself is shown to be an open and active programme, rather than a fixed calculative practice. Research limitations/implications: The intensive nature of the research means that only a limited number of cases were explored. Further research could test theories developed here against evidence collected from a wider range of cases, e.g. other types of providers or non-adopters. Practical implications: The research makes a strong contribution to practice in the form of a re-conceptualisation of how social impact measurement can be shown to be effective, based on a deeper understanding of causal mechanisms, how they interact and the outcomes that result. This is of value to the sector as such information could help other organisations both to understand the value of social impact measurement and to provide practical guidance on how to implement it effectively. Social implications: As the practice of impact measurement continues to develop, practitioners will need to be aware of any changes to these contextual factors and consider questions such as: is the context still supportive of impact measurement? Does the practice need to be adjusted to meet the needs of the current context? For instance, the recent tragedy at Grenfell Tower has led to a reconsideration of the role of social housing; a new Green Paper is currently being drafted (Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Government, 2018). This may have a number of implications for social impact measurement, such as a rebalancing of emphasis on outcomes relating to environmental improvements, towards outcomes relating to the well-being of tenants. Originality/value: Existing literature is largely limited to technical guides.

It gives an overview of available methods for social assessment and points to a set of interdisciplinary indicators by which those impacts can be evaluated. Possibilities to use social impact analysis in the assessment of cultural heritage are presented in this paper through two case studies in the Republic of Croatia: the implementation of social evaluation management plan for the old town of Buzet and the evaluation of social effects of investing in the museum Ivana’s House of Fairy Tales. Some qualitative indicators of the collected surveys related to social effects are described, while the analysis of the availability of such indicators and the scientific basis of the collected answers are provided. In conclusion, the contribution of the methodological tools used and social impact assessments in the evaluation of cultural heritage interventions are presented, while suggestions are made for various decision- makers on those broader methods and benefits compared with the use of only financial and economic impact evaluations. © 2022 by the authors.","heritage evaluation; social performance evaluation; sociologic impact assessment; sociological analytical methods","","","","","","City of Ogulin; Croatian Ministry of Science and Education; Ministry of Culture of Croatia; Tourist Board of the city of Ogulin; Horizon 2020, (4385536—06/07/2021, 870954); European Regional Development Fund, ERDF","Funding text 1: This research was co-funded by the Croatian Ministry of Science and Education through the salaries for researchers; and by the SoPHIA Social platform for Holistic Heritage Impact Assessment Project ‘Deliverable D2.2: Case Studies Report’ funded from the EU’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 870954; Ref.

Additionally, it examines the contingent effects of organizational activities, such as the novelty of market offering and the implementation of social performance measurement. Combining Global Entrepreneurship Monitor data in 2009 and 2015 with other cross-national databases, we test our theoretical predictions using 3648 startup social ventures across 42 countries. We find that pro-market institutions have an inverted U-shaped effect on the degree of hybridity in social ventures. Furthermore, the novelty of market offering and social performance measurement attenuate the impact of pro-market institutions on organizational hybridity by shifting the inverted U-shape to relatively negative and linear. Through this cross-level empirical exploration, we develop a richer explanation of organizational hybridity and contribute to the growing literature on social ventures and hybrid organizations. © 2024 British Academy of Management.","","","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (72202038); National Office for Philosophy and Social Sciences, NPOPSS, (20AGL008, 22AZD144)","This work was supported by the National Social Science Foundation of China [No. 20AGL008; No. 22AZD144] and the National Natural Science Foundation of China [No. 72202038].

However, little information exists to classify key impacts or to identify how they vary across mining service towns. In this paper, qualitative social impact assessment techniques have been used to independently assess post-development impacts of mining on six communities in the Bowen Basin in Queensland, following the boom in coal prices between 2003 and 2008. The communities are similar in that they all have at least one mine in the vicinity and have more male than female residents but they differ in town histories, and the size plus growth rate of both their permanent and temporary populations. While the mining boom has been generating social and economic impacts, the pattern of the impacts appears to vary across communities depending on the size of the impact, community structure and history, and the extent to which a non-resident workforce is involved. © 2009 eContent Management Pty Ltd.","Bowen basin; Coal mining; Social impact assessment","","","","","","Australian Camps Association, ACA","The research in this paper has been supported by a research grant from the Australian Coal Association Research Program.","Census Data, (1996); Census Data, (2001); Census Data, (2006); (2008); Brealey T.B., Newton P.W., Migration and new mining towns, Mobility and Community Change in Australia, pp. 48-66, (1978); Burdge R., Fricke P., Finsterbusch K., Freudenberg W., Gramling R., Holden A., Llewellyn L., Petterson J., Thompson J., Williams G., Guidelines and principles for social impact assessment, Environmental Impact Assessment Review, 15, 1, pp. 11-43, (1995); (1999); Social networks of mining town women, Australian Journal of Social Issues, 19, 2, pp. 101-112, (1984); Socio-Economic Impact Assessment and Community Engagement to Reduce Con Id over Mine Operations Research Reports 1-11, (2005); Economic and Social Impacts of the Coppabella and Moorvale Mines Research Reports 1-5.Rockhampton, (2007); Impacts of the Coal Mining Expansion on Moranbah and Associated Community Research Reports 1-7, (2007); Dale A.P., Chapman P., McDonald M.L., Social impact assessment in Queensland: Why practice lags behind legislative opportunity, Impact Assessment, 15, pp. 159-179, (1997); De Vaus D.A., Surveys in Social Research, (1991); Di Milia L., Bowden B., Unanticipated safety outcomes: Shift-work and drive-in, drive-out workforce in Queensland s Bowen Basin, Asia Pacic Journal of Human Resources, 45, 1, pp. 100-112, (2007); Godwin L., Indigenous natural resource management in Central Queensland, Organics, Biotechnology and Indigenous Natural Resource Management in Queensland, pp. 85-106, (2001); Ivanova G., Rolfe J., Lockie S., Timmer V., Assessing social and economic impacts associated with changes in the coal mining industry in the Bowen Basin, Queensland, Australia, Management of Environmental Quality, 18, 2, pp. 211-228, (2007); Joyce S.A., Macfarlane M., Social Impact Assessment in the Mining Industry: Current Situation Andfuture Directions, (2001); Lockie S., Social impact assessment in review: Setting the agenda for impact assessment in the twenty- rst century, Impact Assessment and Project Appraisal, 19, 4, pp. 277-287, (2001); Lockie S., Franettovich M., Petkova-Timmer V., Rolfe J., Ivanova G., Coal mining and the resource community cycle: A longitudinal assessment of the social impacts of the Coppabella coal mine, Environmental Impact Assessment Review, 29, pp. 330-339, (2009); Maude A., Hugo G., Mining settlements in Australia, Coping with Closure: An International Comparison of Mine Town Experiences, pp. 66-94, (1992); Newton P., Robinson I., Settlement options: Avoiding local government with y- in y-out, Resource Development and Local Government: Policies for Growth, Decline and Diversity, pp. 72-81, (1987); Parker P., The cost of remote locations: Queensland coal towns, Resource Communities: Settlement and Workforce Issues, pp. 79-95, (1988); Pilgrim R., Normalisation of the Pilbara townships in Western Australia, Resource Communities: Settlement and Workforce Issues, pp. 245-260, (1988); (2007); (2007); Small Area Crime Pro Les: 2000-01, Belyando (S), Nebo (S), Duaringa (S), Emerald (S), Bauhinia (S), Peak Downs (S) Local Government Areas (Egas), (2002); Small Area Crime Pro Les: 2002-03, Belyando (S), Nebo (S), Duaringa (S), Emerald (S), Bauhinia (S), Peak Downs (S) Local Government Areas (Egas), (2004); (2007); (2008); Robinson I.M., Newton P.W., Settlement options for non-renewable resource development in Canada and Australia: A comparative evaluation and decision framework, Resource Communities: Settlement and Workforce Issues, pp. 313-352, (1988); Rolfe J., Miles B., Lockie S., Ivanova G., Lessons from the social and economic impacts of the mining boom in the Bowen Basin 2004-2006, Australasian Journal of Regional Studies, 13, 2, pp. 134-153, (2007); Sharma P.C., The new mining towns: Outback suburbias?, Mining and Australia, pp. 150-180, (1983); Solomon F., Katz E., Lovel R., (2007); Vanclay F., International principles for social impact assessment, Impact Assessment and Project Appraisal, 21, 1, pp. 5-11, (2003); Vanclay F., Principles for social impact assessment: A critical comparison between the international and US documents, Environmental Impact Assessment Review, 26, 1, pp. 3-14, (2006)","","","","","","","","","10371656","","","","English","Rural Soc.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-77950759973"

Part of this interest has focused on better understanding social enterprises’ impact, especially through practices derived from impact investing and philanthropy such as social impact measurement (SIM). This paper looks at the differences between “traditional” policy (or programme evaluation - PE) as it is carried out by public actors and SIM as it is practiced by impact investors and the stakeholders they support (particularly social enterprises), focusing on what can be learnt from these gaps. We take the case of France, where we compare public praxis for both SIM and PE based on a documentary analysis and complementary interviews. We find that both disciplines are bridged by a common theoretical foundation and, to a certain extent, by participative approaches. We also identify three main gaps, which are (i) the way outcomes are treated in PE and SIM; (ii) how stakeholder participation is managed and how it affects the ownership of the evaluation process by the involved parties; and (iii) how metrics and indicators are approached. We assess the benefits and drawbacks associated with each gap, we determine ways to bridge them and we identify five forces contributing to their creation. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Impact measurement; Programme evaluation; Public management; Social enterprise; Social impact","","","","","","","","AVISE, ESSEC, Mouves, Petit précis de l’évaluation de l'impact social, (2013); Albareda L., Lozano J.M., Ysa T., Public policies on corporate social responsibility: the role of governments in Europe, J.

However, indirect and/or unanticipated impacts that fall outside the scope of specific programme goals and objectives have also been reported. These are mainly impacts associated with the foresight process itself, i.e. with the way in which foresight exercises are designed and implemented. These impacts typically fall in areas such as:•Knowledge creation, diffusion and absorption;•Social capital and networking;•The evolution of strategies to cope with or escape from the negative consequences of a 'risk society'. The diversity of the above areas suggests that foresight process impacts should be interpreted through the lenses of epistemology, sociology, political science, management science and organisational theory. In parallel, given that developments in the above spheres are strongly associated with the evolution of 'participatory knowledge societies', this paper presents an interpretation of foresight process impacts within a conceptual framework that attempts to characterise such societies. Additionally, such an interpretation is conceived as a step towards the development of a conceptual framework aimed at understanding the dynamics of 'foresight systems'. This framework should be capable of explaining the interdependencies and inter-relationships between system elements such as actors, processes, inputs, outputs and impacts, as well as the interaction of the system with the broader socio-technological-economic-political environment. The overall aim of the paper is to develop an impact assessment framework for foresight exercises that assesses the degree to which they promote the development of 'participatory knowledge societies'. The paper is based primarily on research carried out during the preparation of a PhD thesis entitled ""Assessing the contribution of Foresight to a more participatory knowledge society"". The research mainly involved a literature review of available documentation on past and present foresight programmes and their results. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Limited attention has been paid to why organizations resist or challenge impact assessment practices or how prior experience with impact assessment may shape organizational responses. The study draws on interviews with practitioners involved in social enterprise–impact investor dyads in Australia and the United Kingdom. The findings reveal that social enterprises enact either combative or collaborative responses in their relationships with impact investors based on past experiences with impact assessment. The study shows how more experienced social enterprises reach a state of impact lock-in—where they become committed to particular approaches to understanding, measuring, and reporting impact. The article contributes to the literature on impact assessment and impact investment by showing how organizational experience shapes divergent reactions to the demands imposed by impact investors, creating complementary forces of institutionalization and contestation of impact assessment practice. © The Author(s) 2022.","impact investment; institutional theory; organizational imprinting; organizational path dependence; social enterprise; social impact assessment","","","","","","","","Andre K., Cho C.H., Laine M., Reference points for measuring social performance: Case study of a social business venture, Journal of Business Venturing, 33, pp. 660-678, (2018); Arthur W.B., Competing technologies, increasing returns, and lock-in by historical events, The Economic Journal, 99, 394, pp. 116-131, (1989); Arthur W.B., Increasing returns and path dependence in the economy, (1994); Arvidson M., Lyon F., Social impact measurement and non-profit organisations: Compliance, resistance, and promotion, VOLUNTAS: International Journal of Voluntary and Nonprofit Organizations, 25, pp. 869-886, (2014); Barraket J., Yousefpour N., Evaluation and social impact measurement amongst small to medium social enterprises: Process, purpose and value, Australian Journal of Public Administration, 72, pp. 447-458, (2013); Battilana J., Dorado S., Building sustainable hybrid organizations: The case of commercial microfinance organizations, Academy of Management Journal, 53, pp. 1419-1440, (2010); Battilana J., Lee M., Advancing research on hybrid organizing—Insights from the study of social enterprises, The Academy of Management Annals, 8, pp. 397-441, (2014); Battilana J., Sengul M., Pache A.-C., Model J., Harnessing productive tensions in hybrid organizations: The case of work integration social enterprises, Academy of Management Journal, 58, pp. 1658-1685, (2015); Benjamin L.M., Account space: How accountability requirements shape nonprofit practice, Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector Quarterly, 37, 2, pp. 201-223, (2008); Bjerregaard T., Jonasson C., Managing unstable institutional contradictions: The work of becoming, Organization Studies, 35, pp. 1507-1536, (2014); Boeker W., Strategic change: The effects of founding and history, Academy of Management Journal, 32, pp. 489-515, (1989); Boyatzis R.E., Transforming qualitative information: Thematic analysis and code development, (1998); Brandsen T., Karre P.M., Hybrid organizations: No cause for concern?, International Journal of Public Administration, 34, 13, pp. 827-836, (2011); Braun V., Clarke V., Using thematic analysis in psychology, Qualitative Research in Psychology, 3, 2, pp. 77-101, (2006); Bromley P., Powell W.W., From smoke and mirrors to walking the talk: Decoupling in the contemporary world, The Academy of Management Annals, 6, pp. 483-530, (2012); Brown S.L., Eisenhardt K.M., The art of continuous change: Linking complexity theory and time-paced evolution in relentlessly shifting organizations, Administrative Science Quarterly, 42, 1, pp. 1-34, (1997); Campbell D., Lambright K., Bronstein L., In the eyes of the beholders: Feedback motivations and practices among nonprofit providers and their funders, Public Performance & Management Review, 36, pp. 7-30, (2012); Castellas E.I.P., Ormiston J., Findlay S., Financing social entrepreneurship: The role of impact investment in shaping social enterprise in Australia, Social Enterprise Journal, 14, 2, pp. 130-155, (2018); Cho C.H., Laine M., Roberts R.W., Rodrigue M., Organized hypocrisy, organizational façades, and sustainability reporting, Accounting, Organizations and Society, 40, pp. 78-94, (2015); Christiansen L.H., Lounsbury M., Strange Brew: Bridging logics via institutional bricolage and the reconstitution of organizational identity, Institutional logics in action, Part B, (2013); Clementino E., Perkins R., How do companies respond to environmental, social and governance (ESG) ratings?

However, there is a limited application of these assessment methods in the wastewater sector especially for resource recovery to deliver circularity objectives within urban water cycle management. In this regard, the Horizon 2020 SMART-Plant Innovation Action aimed to evaluate holistic impacts of wastewater-based resource recovery by applying and adapting cost benefit and social analysis on innovative technologies (SMARTechs). The SMARTechs were implemented and validated in real wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) across Europe and Mediterranean basin where potential impacts in terms of carbon, material and energy efficiency, recovery and safe reuse were defined. Sixteen bottom-up SMARTech scenarios were analysed for the estimation of technical, economic and social impacts using CBA, social life cycle assessment (S-LCA) and social readiness level (SRL) methods. Overall, the SMARTechs created benefits both from an environmental and social point of view, with a maximum relative total economic value up to +23% compared to baseline scenario (without any SMARTech implementation). In terms of social benefits, the S-LCA highlighted a global positive impact of all the SMARTechs in terms of technical characteristics and social acceptance. Specifically, SMARTech 1 (cellulose recovery) was the most socially accepted solution thanks to its high performance and simplicity. Finally, based on the SRL assessment, most of the SMARTechs were positioned within the SRL range of 6–7, which implies a good societal acceptance and adaptation potential. © 2021","Cost-benefit analysis; Eco-innovative solutions; Resource recovery; Social life cycle assessment; Social readiness level","Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Economic and social effects; Energy efficiency; Investments; Sewage pumping plants; Wastewater reclamation; Wastewater treatment; Water conservation; Water treatment plants; Cost-benefits analysis; Eco-innovative solution; Economic values; Innovative solutions; Readiness levels; Resource recovery; Social life; Social life cycle assessment; Social readiness level; Socio-economics; Life cycle","","","","","H2020 SMART-Plant; Fondazione Cassa di Risparmio di Verona Vicenza Belluno e Ancona; Horizon 2020, (690323)","Funding text 1: Moreover, Alessia Foglia kindly acknowledges the Fondazione Cariverona for funding her Ph.D. scholarship.; Funding text 2: This work was supported by the H2020 SMART-Plant Project, “Scale-Up of Low Carbon Footprint Material Recovery Techniques in Existing Wastewater Treatment Plants”, which has received funding from the European Union Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under grant agreement n° 690323 .

We first describe the breadth of definitions, data sources, and operationalizations of social impact. Based on this analysis, we generate a typology of four approaches to conceptualizing social impact, which we use to organize insights and recommendations regarding improved measurement of the social impact of entrepreneurial ventures. © The Author(s) 2017.","performance measurement; social entrepreneurship; social impact; social performance; social value","","","","","","University of South Carolina, USC","We thank participants at the Sustainability, Ethics and Entrepreneurship Conference and USC Social Entrepreneurship Conference for feedback on a prior version of this paper.","Aerts K., Schmidt T., Two for the price of one?

Although these social impacts typically include education and skills, destination branding, social cohesion, environmental sustainability and sport development, there is currently a lack of consensus on their measurement and focus upon both benefits and costs. In an evolved mega-event landscape which must align with political, social and cultural priorities, sports governing bodies, industry partners, residents and governments are increasingly concerned with qualitative impacts. Accordingly, through a systematic review of the existing literature, this paper assesses the current state of knowledge of the social costs and benefits of mega-events, including how they are identified, defined and measured, highlighting a need for further research to fully understand the social impacts of mega-events. To our knowledge, this is the first review to examine mega-event social impact evaluation, and we therefore provide a useful evidence-based guide to mega-event stakeholders in determining cases for host bids, event planning and related legacy evaluation. Our review culminates in a research agenda, providing practical guidance for future mega-event assessment. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","economic sustainability; indicators; Socioeconomic impacts","governance approach; qualitative analysis; research work; social impact; socioeconomic impact; socioeconomic indicator; stakeholder; sustainability; tourism economics; tourism market","","","","","","","Al-Emadi A., Kaplanidou K., Diop A., Sagas M., Le K.T., Ali-Ali Mustafa S., 2022 Qatar World Cup: Impact perceptions among Qatar residents, Journal of Travel Research, 56, 5, pp. 678-694, (2017); Bauman A., Bellew B., Craig C.L., Did the 2000 Sydney Olympics increase physical activity among adult Australians?, British Journal of Sports Medicine, 49, 4, pp. 243-247, (2015); Beesley L.G., Chalip L., Seeking (and not seeking) to leverage mega-sport events in non-host destinations: The case of Shanghai and the Beijing Olympics, Journal of Sport & Tourism, 16, 4, pp. 323-344, (2014); Buchanan D., Bryman A., The SAGE handbook of organization research methods, (2011); Carmichael F., Grix J., Marques D.P., The Olympic legacy and participation in sport: An interim assessment of Sport England's Active People Survey for sports studies research, International Journal of Sport Policy and Politics, 5, 2, pp. 229-244, (2013); Chalip L., Green B.C., Hill B., Effects of sport event media on destination image and intention to visit, Journal of Sport Management, 17, 3, pp. 214-234, (2003); Chen F., Tian L., Comparative study on residents' perceptions of follow-up impacts of the 2008, Tourism Management, 51, pp. 263-281, (2015); Chen S., Zheng J., Dickson G., An organizational life cycle approach to exploring the elite sport legacy of summer Olympic host nations: The cases of China (Beijing 2008) and Australia (Sydney 2000), The International Journal of the History of Sport, 35, 12-13, pp. 1276-1305, (2018); Chen Z., Wang Y., Li X., Lawton L., It’s not just black or white: Effects of ambivalence on residents’ support for a mega-event, Journal of Hospitality & Tourism Research, 43, 2, pp. 283-313, (2019); Chi C.G.Q., Ouyang Z., Xu X., Changing perceptions and reasoning process: Comparison of residents' pre- and post-event attitudes, Annals of Tourism Research, 70, pp. 39-53, (2018); Chiam M., Cheng E., Residents' perceptions of the inaugural Youth Olympic Games 2010: A cluster analysis, Event Management, 17, 4, pp. 377-389, (2013); Chien P.M., Kelly S.J., Gill C., Identifying objectives for mega-event leveraging: A non-host city case, Marketing Intelligence & Planning, 36, 2, pp. 168-184, (2018); Chien P.M., Ritchie B.W., Shipway R., Henderson H., I am having a dilemma: Factors affecting resident support of event development in the community, Journal of Travel Research, 51, 4, pp. 451-463, (2012); Cleland C.L., Ellaway A., Clark J., Kearns A., Was Glasgow 2014 inspirational?

Hospitals must carry out social accountability behaviors while still providing adequate facilities and services. However, any analysis of social performance still contains many ambiguities and can differ in its reference points depending on the nature of the different stakeholders. The study uses an explanatory study to measure the social performance of hospitals in Indonesia and examine the indicators and dimensions that influence social performance in hospitals the most. Data of 752 accredited hospitals were obtained from the Indonesian Commission on Accreditation of Hospital (ICAHO) in Indonesia. Data analysis was conducted using Structural Equation Model (SEM) methodology and SPSS AMOS software. The study found a significant and positive effect of environmental forces and information technology resources on social performance. Further, the study found that intrapreneurship (entrepreneurship efforts within established institutions) in hospitals mediated the effects of organizational architecture, environment forces, and information technology toward/in favor of social performance. This study contributes to improving the quality healthcare by demonstrating novelty for how social performance can be measured and better efforts adopted to produce more social value-based healthcare through the use of organizational architecture, environmental forces, and information technology. © 2023 World Scientific Publishing Co.","environmental forces;

The aim of this paper is to measure and examine this hypothesis. To test this claim, this research uses the Surat Resource Region in Queensland, Australia, as the case study. Based on the bivariate test, age, gender, occupation type and educational status have varying statistically significant effects on stakeholders’ attitude towards corporate social practices. The multinomial logistic findings showed that only education retained a net effect on a stakeholder's attitude to participation in corporate social practices, where those with a higher level of education are 1.388 times more likely to perceive stakeholder engagement practices as relevant, 2.864 times more likely for social impact assessment practices and 1.430 times more likely for practices aimed at rights of indigenous communities. Findings imply the need for awareness programs to be incorporated into corporate social practices, which can help promote the success of stakeholder-oriented policies. The paper further makes suggestions that have both business strategy and policy planning implications. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.

An integrative model is developed to examine how the three fundamental drivers of corporate social strategies, i.e., business motivations, perceived stakeholder pressures, and top management’s social commitment, influence the use of social performance indicators for internal decision-making and control and how such use impacts companies’ social and economic performance. The results from a survey of 97 Italian companies suggest that economic motivations and top management’s commitment are associated with a more intensive use of social performance indicators for decision-making and control, whereas perceived pressures from stakeholders do not represent a significant determinant of such use. The use of social performance indicators, in turn, is found to directly influence a firm’s social performance and, indirectly, its bottom line. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Business case; Social performance; Social performance measurement systems; Stakeholders; Survey","","","","","","","","Abernethy M.A., Bouwens J., van Lent L., Determinants of control system design in divisionalized firms, The Accounting Review, 79, 3, pp. 545-570, (2004); Abernethy M.A., Vagnoni E., Power, organization design and managerial behaviour, Accounting, Organizations and Society, 29, 3-4, pp. 207-225, (2004); Adams C.A., Internal organizational factors influencing corporate social and ethical reporting.

Although there are significant similarities between the methods, a number of important differences remain. In particular, while SAA involves a more ‘conventional’ mix of narrative and quantitative disclosures, SROI outcomes are more explicitly quantitative and reductive. This is most evident in the production of the ‘SROI ratio’, which calculates a monetised ‘return’ on a notional £1 of investment. In the UK, with available resources becoming increasingly scarce, the third sector is facing demands for increased accountability as well as being encouraged to ‘scale up’ in preparation for assuming greater responsibility for public service delivery. In this context, it is easy to see why the simplicity and clarity of SROI is attractive to policy-makers, fundraisers and investors, who are keen to quantify and express social value creation and thus make comparative assessments of social value. However, this apparent simplicity also risks reducing the measurement of social impact to a potentially meaningless or even misleading headline figure and should therefore be treated with caution. This is especially so where exact measures are unobtainable, and approximations, or so-called ‘financial proxies’, are used. The use of such proxies is highly subjective, especially when dealing with ‘softer’ outcomes. There is nothing to prevent SROI being used within an SAA framework: indeed, a greater emphasis on quantitative data could improve many social accounts. Nevertheless, we conclude that current efforts to promote SROI adoption, to the likely detriment of SAA, may ultimately promote a one-dimensional funder- and investor-driven approach to social impact measurement in the third sector. © 2011 Centre for Social and Environmental Accounting Research.","","","","","","","Economic and Social Research Council, ESRC, (ES/H038906/1)","","Brown J., Fraser M., Approaches and perspectives in social and environmental accounting: An overview of the conceptual landscape, Business Strategy and the Environment, 15, pp. 103-117, (2006); Dey C.R., Social accounting at Traidcraft plc: A struggle for the meaning of fair trade, Accounting, Auditing and Accountability Journal, 20, 3, pp. 423-445, (2007); Dey C.R., Evans R., Gray R.H., Towards social information systems and bookkeeping: A note on developing the mechanisms for social accounting and audit, Journal of Applied Accounting Research, 2, 3, pp. 33-63, (1995); Flockhart A., The use of social return on investment (SROI) & investment ready tools (IRT) to bridge the financial credibility gap, Social Enterprise Journal, 1, 1, pp. 29-42, (2005); Gibbon J., Affleck A., Social enterprise resisting social accounting: Reflecting on lived experience, Social Enterprise Journal, 4, 1, pp. 41-56, (2008); Gibbon R.J., Enacting social accounting within a community enterprise: Actualising hermeneutic conversation, (2010); Gond J.-P., Herrbach O., Social reporting as an organisational learning tool?

The importance of such value creation cannot be understated, yet in an increasingly competitive funding environment, the need to articulate “true” value is paramount. The purpose of this paper is to examine how Australian and US managers of non-profit organisations (NPOs) and foundations view the measurement of the social impact of NPOs. Design/methodology/approach – The paper includes 19 in-depth interviews of non-profit professionals in the USA and Australia. Respondents included non-profit managers, foundation managers and consultants in both countries. Findings – The in-depth interviews found that in both countries respondents generally agreed that objective measures of impact are desirable, but recognised the difficulties in developing objective assessment frameworks enabling comparisons across the non-profit sector. These difficulties, as well as the implications for developing assessments of social value for NPOs, are discussed. This paper demonstrates that there is an opportunity to reposition reporting expectations. The NPO sector can pool together and build on each other’s strengths and market their outcomes as a collective entity. A sector-wide approach provides potential for much needed within-sector mentoring and will showcase the rich and varied outcomes generated by NPOs. Originality/value – This research compares viewpoints in two Western countries, thus offering at least an exploratory examination of social impact assessment from an international perspective. Additionally, this research shows commonalities in terms of what is valued and what is most difficult for non-profits when determining social impact. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","In-depth interviews; Non-profit; Social impact assessment; Social value","","","","","","Pennsylvania State University, PSU","The authors would like to thank the Arthur W.

Subsequently, environmental impact assessment and social impact assessment are carried out mainly to satisfy the statutory agencies. Because of stricter environment regulations in developed and developing countries, quite often impact assessment suggests alternate sites, technologies, designs, and implementation methods as mitigating measures. This causes considerable delay to complete project feasibility analysis and selection as complete analysis requires to be taken up again and again till the statutory regulatory authority approves the project. Moreover, project analysis through above process often results sub-optimal project as financial analysis may eliminate better options, as more environment friendly alternative will always be cost intensive. In this circumstance, this study proposes a decision support system, which analyses projects with respect to market, technicalities, and social and environmental impact in an integrated framework using analytic hierarchy process, a multiple-attribute decision-making technique. This not only reduces duration of project evaluation and selection, but also helps select optimal project for the organization for sustainable development. The entire methodology has been applied to a cross-country oil pipeline project in India and its effectiveness has been demonstrated. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

While the measurement of commercial performance is relatively straightforward and well understood, our understanding of the factors related to measuring social performance is more ambiguous. Is the adoption of social performance measurement (SPM) practices more related to external pressures, such as the need to demonstrate legitimacy to funders and peers, or is it more closely related to the growing rationalization within the social sector? We examine the relationship between external and internal factors and the adoption of SPM using a novel dataset of 1864 nascent social enterprises from around the world. Our findings suggest support for the argument that the adoption of SPM in social enterprise is related to the growing rationalization of the social sector, which challenges some of the past research on this topic, and provides a more nuanced perspective of SPM in social enterprise. © 2017, International Society for Third-Sector Research and The Johns Hopkins University.","Impact measurement; Legitimacy; Rationalization; Social enterprise; Social performance measurement","academic research; data set; organizational framework; performance assessment; research work; social impact assessment; social movement","","","","","Argidius Foundation; Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation, EMKF; Lemelson Foundation; Stichting DOEN","The author wishes to thank Peter Roberts (Emory University), Kathryn Newcomer (George Washington University), Jasmine Johnson (George Washington University), and Jim Koch (Santa Clara University) for their invaluable comments and feedback.

Financial aspects of environmental and social company activities are also included. Companies were categorized as to their actual performance status using a predefined performance framework. Three categories were found: compliance with the law while emphasizing pollution control, pollution prevention and eco-efficiency. Management tools and procedural matters were found to be most relevant for categorization. Often, reported information did not allow for quantitative evaluation of environmental burden reduction. Use of the thematic balanced scorecard format was useful to better understand the strengths and weaknesses of links between objectives and measurements, initiatives and achievements. Improvement as to environmental performance was found to be paralleled by increased social performance, suggesting that a multi-level 'sustainability' performance categorization of these Portuguese companies is feasible. Driving forces for environmental management initiatives were found to differ by category of performance.

Although, its combined use lacks from a methodology or framework, which can assist in measuring those benefits and impacts. To achieve this, a business case tool has been applied in order to measure the benefits and Social Toolkit has been developed to assist the social impact. The results of these measures provided a substantial increment in terms of benefits measurements and social impact assessment in the social impact assessment of the ‘community intervention of proximity’ initiative, which aims to support families affected by poverty and/or victims of social exclusion. The results have shown that there has been a decrease in social exclusion and a reduction in poverty for needy families.

However, despite the top-down indications for disclosing and reporting sustainability practices provided by this new policy, financial actors still lack a comprehensive framework on how to track and measure their social and environmental contributions within the perimeter of this novel institutional context. This paper discusses the implications for financial actors brought by the SDFR and builds a conceptual link with social impact measurement practices. In particular, the article provides a comprehensive framework that identifies strategic approaches and measurement tools for financial actors for building a more sustainable finance, that is a finance focused on the purest dimension of blended value and more attentive to sustainable development. © 2022 The Authors.

Our goal is to shed light on the unlocked potential of the knowledge produced by a global community of scholars and practitioners engaged in social impact measurement processes. Global open data on social impact assessment (SIA) have been mapped and collected in a database using the impact chain as a reference point for choosing the variables. In this paper, we focus on the potential use of these data to enable forecasting analysis about the expected social value and to inform decision-making processes aimed at responding to complex social challenges. The early findings suggest the opportunity of a wider action-research initiative, by engaging different typologies of stakeholders and organizations aimed at incorporating social impact as a key strategic driver. © 2020 Journal of Entrepreneurial and Organizational Diversity","IMPACT CHAIN; SOCIAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT; SROI","","","","","","","","Agarwal R., Dhar V., Big Data, Data Science, and Analytics: The Opportunity and Challenge for IS Research, Information Systems Research, 25, 3, pp. 443-448, (2014); Akter S., Wamba S., Gunasekaran A., Dubey R., Childe S., How to improve firm performance using big data analytics capability and business strategy alignment?, International Journal of Production Economics, 182, pp. 113-131, (2016); Arce-Gomez A., Donovan J., Bedggood R., Social impact assessments: Developing a consolidated conceptual framework, Environmental Impact Assessment Review, 50, pp. 85-94, (2015); Arvidson M., Lyon F., McKay S., Moro D., Valuing the social?

To fill this gap, the authors ran a Social Return on Investment (SROI) analysis on four units of the largest BDA in Italy, the Association of Voluntary Italian Blood Donors (“Avis”). This study used multiple methods for data collection and analysis. A systematic literature review helped the identification of proper financial proxies to highlight the economic value of the social and health impacts experienced by Avis members. A focus group with key informants gathered their views on the areas of impact selected for the analysis: early detection of diseases, adoption of healthier lifestyles, social capital, human capital, personal satisfaction and reinforcement of a ‘giving culture’. Primary data collection involved (a) an Activity Based Costing analysis (b) a self-reported questionnaire to 1.066 BDA members and unassociated donors enabling the comparison of the blood donation experience of these two groups. The SROI analysis resulted in four positive ratios, varying between €1.70 and €13.80. This study contributes to the knowledge on impact evaluations in TSOs. Policy implications refer to BDAs deserving financial and material support for their capacity to generate positive social impacts. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Blood donation; Blood Donors Associations; Social impact evaluation; Social Return on Investment (SROI); Third Sector","Adult; Altruism; Blood Donors; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Female; Focus Groups; Healthy Lifestyle; Humans; Italy; Male; Middle Aged; Personal Satisfaction; Program Evaluation; Social Capital; Social Support; Socioeconomic Factors; Italy; finance; health care; health impact; literature review; social impact; social policy; voluntary approach; adult; altruism; blood donor; cost benefit analysis; female; healthy lifestyle; human; information processing; Italy; male; middle aged; program evaluation; psychology; satisfaction; social capital; social support; socioeconomics","","","","","","","Alfieri S., Guiddi P., Marta E., Saturni V., Economic crisis and blood donation: How are donors’ motivations changing?, Transfusion and Apheresis Science, 54, 3, pp. 396-400, (2016); Arvidson M., Lyon F., McKay S., Moro D., The ambitions and challenges of SROI, (2010); Arvidson M., Lyon F., McKay S., Moro D., Valuing the social?

They seek to use policies and funds attached to infrastructure development and construction to encourage private sector companies to provide training, employment and business opportunities for Indigenous people in the communities in which construction occurs. This paper outlines the rise of these policies and their origins, and critiques their connection to Indigenous people’s human rights, impact measurement, evaluation and accountability mechanisms. In doing so this paper also explores benefits and potential of social procurement policies, as well as risks. Drawing on insights from an Aboriginal-developed evaluation framework, Ngaa-bi-nya, and Indigenous Standpoint Theory, this paper highlights Indigenous peoples’ definitions of value and outlines their relevance to social procurement. Introducing the notion of cultural counterfactuals into social impact measurement research, it also offers a new conceptual framework to enable policymakers and practitioners to more accurately account for social procurement value and impact, including Indigenous people’s notions of social value. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Australia; counterfactuals; social impact measurement; social procurement; social value; sustainable procurement","Australia; Canada; South Africa; Construction; Project management; Business opportunities; Conceptual frameworks; Evaluation framework; Impact measurements; Indigenous people; Infrastructure development; Private sector companies; Procurement policy; accountability; business development; construction; employment; equity; human rights; indigenous population; infrastructural development; policy approach; private sector; social policy; state role; training; Economic and social effects","","","","","","","Abbott A.F., Anticompetitive market distortions as an ungoverned space, and prospects for reform, SAIS review of international affairs, 36, 2, pp. 87-102, (2016); Construction the biggest riser in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander industry data: media release, (2017); Estimates of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians, June 2016, (2018); Arbon V., Arlathirnda Ngurkarnda Ityirnda: being-knowing-doing: de-colonising Indigenous tertiary education, (2008); Indigenous economic development strategy 2011–2018, (2011); Commonwealth Indigenous procurement policy: 1 July 2015, (2015); Barraket J., Weissman J., Social procurement and its implications for social enterprise: a literature review.

Five phases are recognized that reflect different ways of dealing with too much tourism over time, after which the impact of a sudden lack of tourism is investigated in light of future renewal processes. This discussion highlights the remarkable capacity of the tourism industry to adjust to rapidly changing circumstances and crises, even when these cause anguish to individuals and within societies at large. The paper thus seeks to contextualize the current discussions regarding the transformation of tourism post COVID-19. It highlights the complexity of changing a tourism that multiple stakeholders depend on or have grown accustomed to. To come to a more balanced tourism, it is necessary to not only come up with alternative visions and strategies, but also to engage with the political economy nature of tourism development. A future research agenda should therefore also discuss facets of entangled power, social exclusion, inequalities and class differences to come to new reference points of what actually constitutes a more inclusive tourism success. © 2021 The Author(s).

The large volume of e-waste generated can be a potential source of resource and energy, hence, providing a complementa-ry means to the primary extraction of minerals such as copper and gold in addition to promoting a circular economic model. In the Philippines, informal gold recovery is one of the sinks for such e-waste. Design/Methodology/Approach – This study evaluated the potentials of informal gold recovery from end-of-life cellular phones from the perspective of environmental soundness and socio-economic viability. It aimed to serve as a baseline measurement of the economic benefits of e-waste material recovery to strengthen the need to establish an effective e-waste management framework and tap its potentials as an emerging sector in the economy. Process-based Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) was conducted using 100g Au with data collected much earlier. The resulting impacts to human health and the environment were determined following the procedure indicated in ReCiPe (2008). Benefit-cost (BC) ratio was also computed as the measure of economic benefit while, for the social impacts, a criticality score was computed. Findings – Results of the environmental impact assessment showed that informal gold recovery poses a large threat to human health due to the emitted gases. This result is verified by the high risk computed in the social impact assessment contributed primarily by the risk of poisoning, risk of acquiring eye injury and respiratory and nervous system diseases from inhalation of fumes. Nevertheless, the risks were lessened with improvements in the system. A benefit-cost ratio of 1.21 was computed, entailing an economic benefit from this practice, with labor cost contributing the highest. Research Implications – Informal gold recovery is potentially sustainable, but to reap the greatest benefits and reduce the risks, some actions or interventions at the operational and national level are needed, such as usage of less hazardous substances, reduction of labor and protection of workers, utilization of methods engineering to improve efficiency and cost-effectiveness, formulation and assessment of national e-wastes inventory, and implementation of an e-waste management system policy to harness global business and trade opportunities. © 2020 International Academy of Global Business and Trade.

This paper presents a credit score system for them. The model evaluates social and financial aspects of the borrower. The financial aspects are evaluated under the conventional banking framework, by analysing accounting statements and financial projections. The social aspects try to quantify the loan impact on the achievement of Millennium Development Goals such as employment, education, environment, health or community impact. The social credit score model should incorporate the lender’s know-how and should also be coherent with its mission. This is done using Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM). The paper illustrates a real case: a loan application by a social entrepreneur presented to a socially responsible lender. The decision support system not only produces a score, but also reveals strengths and weaknesses of the application. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Credit scoring; Ethical banking; Financial ratios; Multi-criteria decision making (MCDM); Social impact assessment","","","","","","Ministerio de Educación, Cultura y Deporte, MECD; European Regional Development Fund, ERDF","The work reported in this paper was supported by Grants ECO2010-20228 and ECO2013-45568-R of the Spanish Ministry of Education and Science, and the European Regional Development Fund and by grant Ref.

By and large, it is seen as a product of financialization: some argue that the social is colonized by financial actors and methods, others see it as a site where boundary work produces a state of value plurality in which competing values—social and financial—co-exist. This article takes the latter perspective further and unpacks the endogenous dynamics underpinning the creation of social values in impact investing programs. It analyzes how high-level organizations in the field prescribed specific social impact valuation processes and mechanisms for collecting, measuring, and reporting data about value creation. It argues that the social values circulating in the impact investing field emerge from the interplay between a wide array of stakeholders, impact investors included. The social impact accounting tools that capture them materialize therefore as sites of political battles and negotiations between stakeholders, with both emancipatory but also exploitative potential. This has consequences upon our understanding of how financialization travels and how the social dynamics underpinning accounting devices (re)draw boundaries between competing values and fields. © The Author(s) 2022.","boundary work; financialization; impact investing; Social policy; valuation","","","","","","Accounting Department; Anastasia Nesvetailova; Economic and Social Research Council, ESRC, (ES/T008687/1); Economic and Social Research Council, ESRC","Funding text 1: The author is grateful to Andrea Mennicken, Mike Power, Peter Miller, and all the AC500 seminar participants in the Accounting Department at the LSE where two versions of this article were probed.

Each method uses specific indicators, mainly because of the diverse characteristics of social enterprises (SEs) and the type of impact that is analysed, thus hindering the definition of a single, shared measurement system and, at the same time, prompting the proliferation of countless alternative methods. Many enterprises experience difficulties in selecting the best method to carry out the measurement process correctly. The purpose of this paper is to contribute to filling in conceptual gaps inherent to measuring impact and value creating in the domain of social entrepreneurship (SE), as well as equipping the social entrepreneur with better knowledge of the methodologies available for measuring impact and supporting their decision-making process. Design/methodology/approach: The aims of this paper are, therefore, threefold: to identify the common conditions of how to measure social impact (literature); to analyse how measurement is actually undertaken in practice (process); and to compare the four main methodologies, among the numerous ones, that have been developed to measure the impact generated by SEs so far (methods and comparison). The authors compared four of the most commonly used methodologies in the field of social impact measurement, analysing advantages, disadvantages and application fields. They evaluated whether a method can be considered preferable to others in each case. Findings: The paper demonstrated the high fragmentation that characterised the existing literature concerning the measurement of social impact and the wide range of methodologies used, thus leading to a great confusion in regard to the selection of the most appropriate methodology for the pursuit of one's own ends. This often discourages the undertaking of the measurement process. The analysis used in this paper leads us to conclude that the social return on investment method is more popular than the other three alternatives. Research limitations/implications: There are significant deficiencies in methodologies adopted, and researchers must use innovative, situated approaches that fit with the SE literature. The authors concluded that for the future, there is a need to do a SLR in a disciplined way. Further research is strongly recommended in this area, to provide more comparative studies of existing methods. It is hoped that enterprises can be directed towards using a limited range of formal methods that can capture the diversity of the various application cases, thus making it possible to compare different situations: a limited range of formal methods that can capture the diversity of the SEs considered and the impacts generated will be promoted. Practical implications: The authors also want to analyse how the SEs concretely realise the measurement of their impact that often do not use the formal methodologies presented in the literature but rather tools created by the ad hoc companies on the basis of their specific needs. Originality/value: This paper makes a theoretical contribution to the literature of the theory on social value within the SE field by having regard to how to measure social impact. It partially responds to Choi and Majumdar’s (2014) and Hlady-Rispal and Servantie’s (2016) calls for the development of a theory of measuring social value. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Measurements; Measuring; Social enterprise; Social entrepreneurship; Social impact; Social value creation; SROI","","","","","","","","Arena M., Azzone G., Bengo I., Performance measurement for social enterprises, VOLUNTAS: International Journal of Voluntary and Nonprofit Organizations, 26, 2, pp. 649-672, (2015); Arvidson M.L., Valuing the social?

Based on two experimental studies, I examine how two different signalling strategies—the social entrepreneur's reputation (based on awards, fellowships, and prizes) and accountability (based on a social impact measurement system)—influence crowdfunders’ decisions when evaluating an early-stage social venture. In the first 2 × 2 between-subjects experiment, I find an interaction suggesting that accountability increases the funding amount provided by crowdfunders only when the social entrepreneur does not signal a strong reputation. In a follow-up 1 × 2 between-subjects experiment, I replicate the negative effect of reputation. However, based on qualitative data, I do not find that crowdfunders consciously evaluate reputation based on awards, fellowships, and prizes as a negative signal. Overall, the results suggest that signalling accountability based on implementing a social impact measurement system is a better strategy for crowdfunding campaigns than investing in reputation building or sending both signals simultaneously in the early stages of a social venture. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Crowdfunding; Experiment; Reputation; Social entrepreneurship; Social impact measurement","","","","","","Aleksandra Kacperczyk; Bill Messier; Hervé Stolowy; Iqbal Quadir; MIT Sloan School's Legatum Center for Development and Entrepreneurship; Thomas Astebro; Massachusetts Institute of Technology, MIT; University of Nevada, Las Vegas, UNLV; Higher Education Commission, Pakistan, HEC","I am grateful for feedback received from Hervé Stolowy (HEC Paris), Sebastian Becker (HEC Paris), Thomas Astebro (HEC Paris), Sebastian Hafenbrädl (IESE Barcelona), Aleksandra Kacperczyk (MIT), Iqbal Quadir (MIT), Bill Messier (UNLV), participants at the EAA Annual Congress in Maastricht and the IESE-LUISS Conference on Responsibility, Sustainability and Social Entrepreneurship, workshop participants at WU Vienna, and fellows at MIT Sloan School's Legatum Center for Development and Entrepreneurship.

The challenge is that there is no common standard for social impact assessment. This article aims to contribute to this contemporary discussion on impact measurement of social enterprises and events, proposing a measuring framework. The framework offers utility for inclusive stakeholder collaboration and the incorporation of diverse developmental theories. It highlights the systematic link between contextual insight on states of disequilibrium, opportunities, and developmental ideas. As a diagnostic tool, the socioeconomic impact framework offers utility to stakeholders as it coordinates and guides the processes to identify and communicate a contextual theory of change. It promotes inclusive collaboration reflective processes, offering guidance to stakeholders as they explore insight into the contextual disequilibrium and the opportunity tension it creates, aligned with a theory of change that offers progressive developmental impact. © 2023 Cognizant, LLC.

This is despite the enormous untapped potential of the facilities management sector to create social value in the communities in which they operate. To address this gap in research, this paper presents an in-depth case study of an innovative social procurement initiative developed by a major Australian facilities management organisation. Integrating research in the fields of employment studies, facilities management and social value, it provides new empirical evidence of the significant affective, cognitive, behavioural and situational social value outcomes which can be generated through facilities management. These are best achieved through new hybrid partnerships between business, government, not-for-profit, community and educational organisations which create shared value, underpinned by a common interest in maximising social value for the communities involved. More research is needed into the types of attributes, skills and resources that facilitate such outcomes, the attributes of organisations most likely to be able to collaborate and the types of cross-sector partnerships which work. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Built environment;

Design/methodology/approach: Specifically, the paper explores SIA as a methodological tool for post-project evaluation, used to define projects’ contributions to aspects of social sustainability through analyzing impacts of participation in a rural context case study, that of the Scapa Flow landscape heritage scheme in Orkney Islands, Scotland, UK. Findings: Based on research findings from the thematic analysis of 40 semi-structured interviews on impacts (with heritage managers, planners and participants in the scheme), the paper proposes a combination of heritage value assessment process with social impact identification to achieve a context-relevant assessment of social sustainability. Existing research around social capital and sense of place supports the analysis of relevant impacts and heritage values. Findings support overlaps between socio-environmental impacts, when looking at the role of heritage for community well-being in rural contexts. Research limitations/implications: The qualitative approach allows for a context-relevant, bottom up impact assessment and allows for multiple stakeholders perceptions to be included. Practical implications: The proposed methodological approach has greater implications for the work of institutions and professionals involved in project evaluations that can inform participatory heritage project planning, ensuring high social relevance. Social implications: Application of SIA principles in heritage sector can increase social benefits of heritage projects and enable wider community participation in processes of heritage management. Originality/value: Through this case study, the effectiveness of SIA principles when applied in cultural heritage project evaluation is discussed, reflecting on a novel methodology for impact assessment in heritage. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Cultural heritage; Evaluation; Heritage management; Indicators; Participation; Rural landscape; Social impact assessment; Value assessment","","","","","","European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development, EAFRD","The scheme under focus was realized between 2009 and 2012, thanks to a fund of £1,355,800 mainly by Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF) and also supported by European Rural Development fund. It included 44 small projects and involved local communities around the parishes of the realized projects in the course of the three years. The whole scheme had a special focus on achieving public engagement, expressed through specific objectives for including communities in projects. Management of projects was realized by the same local institutions that regularly deal with the specific heritage typologies in the area, including: local authority run-museums, local heritage trusts and associations, research centers working with archeology and Historic Environment Scotland.","Arce-Gomez A., Donovan J.D., Bedggood R.E., Social impact assessments: developing a consolidated conceptual framework, Environmental Impact Assessment Review, 50, pp. 85-94, (2015);

One such technology is the use of charcoal from biomass in steelmaking. This paper adapts social life cycle assessment methodologies to analyse the social dimensions of energy supply alternatives in steelmaking using regionalised production scenarios in Australia. Three energy supply alternatives are investigated: charcoal produced from Radiata pine plantation forestry; charcoal produced from Mallee eucalypt revegetation on agricultural land; and metallurgical coal. Impact indicators analysed include land-use, employment, workplace health & safety and a qualitative analysis of identified stakeholder issues. The research finds that biomass alternatives are significant generators of direct employment at the regional level; have concomitantly higher rates of workplace injuries and represent a significant change in landuse. Charcoal produced from Mallee biomass planted as a conservation measure on farmland, however, has the benefit of representing a shared land-use that provides an additional farm revenue stream and assists dryland salinity management. The paper finds that full substitution of coal by pine or Mallee charcoal does not provide a unique solution for optimising the social performance of the energy supply alternatives across all indicators. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Recent research has demonstrated that blockchain can play an important role in promoting supply chain sustainability. In this paper we argue that blockchain's characteristics are especially important for enforcing sustainability standards in developing countries. We analyze multiple case studies of blockchain projects implemented in supply chains in developing countries to assess product quality, environmental accounting and social impact measurement. We have developed seven propositions, which describe how blockchain can help address a number of challenges various stakeholders face in promoting sustainable supply chains in developing countries. The challenges that the propositions deal with include those associated with an unfavorable institutional environment, high costs, technological limitations, unequal power distribution among supply chain partners and porosity and opacity of value delivery networks. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Blockchain; Developing countries; Ethical dilemmas; Institutions; Smart contract; Supply chain; Sustainability; Traceability","Blockchain; Supply chain management; Supply chains; Sustainable development; Anecdotal evidences; Block-chain; Chain management; Developed countries; Ethical dilemma; Recent researches; Smart contract; Sustainability principles; Sustainable supply chains; Traceability; Developing countries","","","","","","","ABInBev, How we are empowering barley farmers in Uganda, (2019); Agarwal M., Blockchain: India likely to see brain drain as 80% developers may move abroad, (2018); Alba D., Alibaba reveals a new kind of QR code to fight counterfeits, (2015); Ball A., Owen D.L., Gray R.H., External transparency or internal capture?

Taking a preliminary step toward NGO funding, we consider the current lack of information disclosure in existing reporting practices, which are diverse and unsustainable. We investigate key organisational information in order to discover any potential links between funding sources and disclosure practices. In Italy, today there is an on-going effort to encourage public engagement in civil society. A percentage-tax law allows taxpayers to dedicate ‘cinque per mille’ (one-half percent) of their income to NGOs, which is then deducted from their tax obligation (Hereafter, ‘5 per thousand’). Our primary research objective is to understand if there is a link between the ‘5 per thousand’ donations that NGOs receive for providing social impact, and their reporting practices. Therefore, we critically analyse if and how sustainable reporting practices are achieved within the top 100 most funded NGOs that receive the ‘5 per thousand’ donation. We examine public data from official government records published by the Italian Revenue Agency. The findings suggest that sustainability reporting offers a number of financial and social advantages, including social impact that builds trust towards the idea of civil society and its funders. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","NGO funding; Social impact disclosure; Social impact measurement; Sustainability reporting","","","","","","","","Adams C., Understanding integrated reporting: The concise guide to integrated thinking and the future of corporate reporting, (2017); Argenti P., Saghabalyan A., Reputation at risk: The social responsibility of NGOs, Corporate Reputation Review, 20, 1, pp. 1-26, (2017); (2018); Anheier H., Hass R., Then V., Beller A., Wehrsig S., Accountability & transparency: A comparative study of German non-profit organisations, public agencies and for-profit corporations, A collaborative project of the Hertie School of Governance (HSoG) and the Centre for Social Investment (CSI) of Heidelberg University, pp. 1-5, (2011); Arenas D., Lozano J.M., Albareda L., The role of NGOs in CSR: Mutual perceptions among stakeholders, Journal of Business Ethics, 88, 1, pp. 175-197, (2009); Badelt C., Meyer M., Simsa R., Handbuch der nonprofit organisation: Strukturen und management, (1999); Baumgartner R.J., Rauter R., Strategic perspectives of corporate sustainability management to develop a sustainable organisation, Journal of Cleaner Production, 140, pp. 81-92, (2017); Behn B.K., DeVries D.D., Lin J., The determinants of transparency in nonprofit oganisations: An exploratory study, Advances in Accounting, 26, 1, pp. 6-12, (2010); Berthelot S., Coulmont M., Serret V., Do investors value sustainability reports?

The SVI framework measures tourism impacts and compares these to desired levels of development for particular sites across a range of sustainable indices. It is proposed that the SVI framework serves as a more flexible and systematic method for assessing visitor impacts than previous VMFs, which takes seriously the value dimension of destination management and the need to balance social and environmental needs. To demonstrate how the framework is applied, findings are presented from an SVI study conducted on Rottnest Island, Western Australia, involving a survey of 2,423 visitors across nine sites and an expert-based impact assessment. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","carrying capacity; environmental impact assessment; limits of acceptable change; Social impact assessment; visitor management frameworks","Australia; Rottnest Island; Western Australia; carrying capacity; ecotourism; environmental impact assessment; social impact assessment; sustainability; tourism management; tourist destination","","","","","Rottnest Island Authority","This research was funded by the Rottnest Island Authority through a public tender.

In the manufacturing phase, research has often focused solely on environmental impact assessment or environmental impact and cost analysis in its assessment of sustainability. Few efforts have investigated sustainable production decision making that addresses the three pillars of sustainability concurrently; which requires engineers and managers to consider economic, environmental, and social impacts. An approach is developed to assess broader sustainability impacts by conducting economic assessment, environmental impact assessment, and social impact assessment at the work cell level. Assessment results are then integrated into a sustainable manufacturing assessment framework, along with a modified weighting method based on pairwise comparison and an outranking decision-making method. The approach is illustrated for a representative machining work cell producing stainless steel knives. Economic, environmental, and social impact results are compared for three production scenarios by applying the sustainable manufacturing assessment framework. The case study finds that cutting tool cost is the largest contributor to production costs for the investigated work cell. The level of environmental and social impact varies according to cycle time. Sensitivity analysis is conducted to examine the robustness of the results. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Organizations involved in tourism will benefit from understanding how best to implement events which impact host cities’ development. This paper explores the impact on host cities of sponsoring an event portfolio, comprising many different types of events. An empirical study analysed 230 tourism events hosted in mainland China. A multiple regression analysis was performed to test various hypotheses. The findings show that event ‘strength’ (i.e. the level of internationalization, number of participants, and continuity of events) can increase event attractiveness. Consequently, such events promote economic development in host cities. However, levels of government support were found to have negative impacts on host cities’ economies. It is worth mentioning that the duration of tourism events has an inverted U-shaped relationship to economic development. As for spatial distribution of events, we found that locating them in provincial capitals had stronger positive impacts on host cities’ economic development and attractiveness. Marketing strategies are proposed to meet target goals. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","attractiveness; China; economic development; event attributes; host city; Tourism events","China; economic development; implementation process; marketing; organizational framework; social impact assessment; tourism; urban development; urban economy","","","","","National Social Science Foundation of China, (17CGL046); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, (JS2019HGXJ0018, JZ2019HGBZ0154)","This work was supported by the financial support from the National Social Science Foundation of China under [grant number 17CGL046]; the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities under [grant number JS2019HGXJ0018] and [grant number JZ2019HGBZ0154].

In a certain context, social impact assessment is a novel way to reveal the extent of effectiveness for these projects. This case study presents an Expert System based methodology regarding social impact assessment for two urban security management projects in Pakistan. An Expert System, DoctuS is employed as a tool to build a rule-based model tool using social impact attributes (as variables) from literature and expert knowledge (Author’s own insight as being involved in projects). Case-based reasoning (CBR) method is employed for the measurement of the impact of urban security management KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) in the two case projects. The empirical findings in this case study approaches the impact assessment by quantitative analysis of crime rates in JMP statistical package and Qualitative Expert knowledge-based model in DoctuS. Thereby, the study evaluates the pre and post ante project situations in order to assess the project’s effectiveness and impact on improved urban safety and security. In the first step, the projects are briefly described, followed by the crime rate analysis under the project jurisdictions and rules between attributes are defined. The second step defines the qualitative rule-based model along with the two cases described, and validated in DoctuS tool. Some attributes and rules have changed, and a new concise model is presented. The Expert System compares the project cases and evaluates the social impact assessment based on the defined KPIs. The Expert system validation presents a novel model for social impact assessment of subject urban security management projects. We propose this methodology and model as useful in investigating social impact assessment of projects specifically dealing with urban safety and security management. However, the generalizability of the findings of this case-study based articles need more sophisticated tests as recommendation for the extension to this study © 2024 Ghani et al.","case-based reasoning; crime rates analysis; Expert system; social impact assessment in Pakistan; urban safety and security","","","","","","","","Population of the world countries and their projections, (2020); Punjab Bureau of statistics Data sets, (2018); Aeberhard A., Rist S., Transdisciplinary co-production of knowledge in the development of organic agriculture in Switzerland, Ecological Economics, 68, pp. 1171-1181, (2009); Ahmad A., Et al., A complex network-based approach for security and governance in the smart green city, Expert Systems with Applications, (2020); Althoff K.-D., Case-Based Reasoning and Expert Systems, pp. 1-1, (2012); Avdeenko T.

We examine Chile, which represents a vibrant economy and one of the world's most productive entrepreneurship ecosystems but with a history of socio-economic inequalities and strong profit-driven pressures to overextract natural resources. The study is based on a questionnaire related to manufacturing sent to 112 companies in Chile. The proposed relationships are analysed through structural equation modelling. The results indicate that ILPs fully mediate the effect of entrepreneurial orientation on environmental performance and social performance and partially mediates the effect of entrepreneurial orientation on operational performance. Our study extends the literature by explaining that entrepreneurial orientation builds and strengthens ILPs for creating triple bottom line competitive advantage. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment","entrepreneurial orientation; internal lean practices; sustainability; triple bottom line","Chile; entrepreneur; environmental impact assessment; industrial performance; manufacturing; profitability; social impact assessment; socioeconomic conditions; sustainable development","","","","","Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Científico y Tecnológico, FONDECYT, (11140599)","This project was funded by Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Científico y Tecnológico, Project number: 11140599.","Abdulmalek F.A., Rajgopal J., Analysing the benefits of lean manufacturing and value stream mapping via simulation: A process sector case study, International Journal of Production Economics, 107, 1, pp. 223-236, (2007); Amankwah-Amoah J., Danso A., Adomako S., Entrepreneurial orientation, environmental sustainability and new venture performance: Does stakeholder integration matter?, Business Strategy and the Environment, 28, pp. 79-87, (2018); Anderson B.S., Eshima Y., The influence of firm age and intangible resources on the relationship between entrepreneurial orientation and firm growth among Japanese SMEs, Journal of Business Venturing, 28, pp. 413-429, (2013); Anderson-Connolly R., Grunberg L., Greenberg E.S., Moore S., Is lean mean?

To support on-ground operational staff, we offer the Human Rights Sphere (HRS), a practical tool we developed from empirical research in three large-scale projects and from an analytical literature review. The tool is consistent with the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGP). The HRS comprises seven steps through which the understanding and addressing of the social and human rights impacts of projects and corporate human rights due diligence procedures can be enhanced. The HRS describes the various groups of rights-holders to be considered, the social and environmental impacts they may experience, and how these impacts can be linked to actual or potential human rights impacts. The HRS shows how corporate mitigation and compensation practices have to be improved to prevent human rights harm to workers and communities. The HRS presents a comprehensive picture of the human rights side of projects and is presented as a practical tool that can be utilized by operational staff at all project phases. By utilising the HRS, multinational corporations will be better equipped to address the adverse human rights impacts of large projects. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Corporate social responsibility; Human rights based approach; Social impact assessment; Social impacts; Social licence to operate; Social risks","Environmental impact; Risk assessment; Social aspects; Corporate social responsibilities (CSR); Human rights; Social impact; Social impact assessments; Social licence to operate; Social risks; Economic and social effects","","","","","","","Anaya J., Report of the Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.

Box 217, Netherlands","In the social sciences, non-utilization of knowledge is a major problem. Many publications stored in libraries or available on the Internet should be used more than they are now. Conventional approaches like providing abstracts and lists of keywords have proven to be insufficient. For more than thirty years already, meta-analysis is available for the accumulation and dissemination of scientific knowledge. In the social sciences, meta-analysis has been used on a limited scale only, mainly because there still remains a gap between the knowledge available and its application in policymaking. Recently, value transfer has been introduced as an additional method to bridge the gap between available knowledge and the demands for knowledge in new problem areas. Not only in the social sciences but also in the information sciences non-utilization of information is a major problem. It is the mission of tech mining to contribute to a mitigation of this non-utilization. In this article, we will show how tech mining could profit from innovations in meta-analysis and social impact assessment. Special attention will be paid to research on technology generations, research on social change in cohesive social systems showing solidarity at work, and tech mining in support of the Lisbon Strategy of the European Commission. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

It recommends that analysts examine the infrastructural demands of new computing developments and social outcomes on 12 different criteria. Social impact analysis can be used to evaluate and select among different system alternatives and to monitor a selected system as it evolves. This paper recommends a ten stage political process which requires a project to be tracked from the early stages of design, through its implementation, and during the period it is used. The concepts developed draw upon the literatures of social impact analysis and urban planning. © 1984.","Computer-based technologies; Social impact analysis; Urban planning","URBAN PLANNING - Computer Applications; COMPUTER-BASED TECHNOLOGIES; SOCIAL IMPACT ANALYSIS; TECHNOLOGY","","","","","","","Kling, Scacchi, Recurrent dilemmas of routine computer use in complex organizations, Proc National Computer Conference, 48, pp. 107-115, (1979); Kling, Social analyses of computing theoretical perspectives in recent empirical research, ACM Computing Surveys, 12, 1, pp. 61-110, (1980); Markus, Power, politics, and MIS implementation, Communications of the ACM, 26, 6, pp. 430-444, (1983); Walton, Vittori, Office: Technology and People, (1983); Zuboff, New worlds of computer-mediated work, Harvard Business Review, pp. 142-152, (1982); Mumford, Designing Secretaries: The Participative Design of a Word Processing System, (1983); Mumford, Designing Secretaries: The Participative Design of a Word Processing System, (1983); Taylor, Designing an organization and an information system for ‘Central Stores’: a study in participative socio-technical analysis and design, Systems, Objectives, and Solutions, 2, 2, pp. 67-76, (1982); King, Schrems, Cost-benefit in information systems development and operation, ACM Computing Surveys, pp. 19-34, (1978); Rule, Insight and Social Betterment, A Preface to Applied Social Science, (1978); Bolan, Emerging views of planning, Journal of the American Institute of Planners, 33, 4, pp. 233-245, (1967); Jencks, Modern Movements in Architecture, (1973); Jencks, Modern Movements in Architecture, (1973); Goodman, Goodman, Communitas: Means of Livelihood and Ways of Life, (1960); Rudofsky, Streets for People: A Primer for Americans, (1969); Wiendehoft, Cities for People: Practical Measures for Improving Urban Environments, (1981); Kling, Scacchi, The web of computing: computer technology as social organization, Advances in Computers, 21, (1982); Kling, Social analyses of computing theoretical perspectives in recent empirical research, ACM Computing Surveys, 12, 1, pp. 61-110, (1980); Kling, Scacchi, The web of computing: computer technology as social organization, Advances in Computers, 21, (1982); Kling, Scacchi, The web of computing: computer technology as social organization, Advances in Computers, 21, (1982); Kling, Models for the social accountability of computing, Telecommunications Policy, 4, 3, pp. 166-182, (1980); Finsterbusch, Understanding Social Impacts: Assessing the Effects of Public Projects, (1980); Markus, Understanding information system use in organizations: a theoretical explanation, Ph.D Dissertation, (1979); Kling, Social analyses of computing theoretical perspectives in recent empirical research, ACM Computing Surveys, 12, 1, pp. 61-110, (1980); Mumford, The participative design of clerical information systems: two case studies, The Human Side of Information Processing, (1980); DiMento, The Consistency Controversy and the Limits of Planning, (1980); DiMento, The Consistency Controversy and the Limits of Planning, (1980); Lofland, Analyzing Social Settings, (1971); Spradley, Participant Observation, (1980); Keen, Information systems and organizational change, Communications of the ACM, 24, 1, pp. 24-33, (1981); Markus, Power, politics and MIS implementation, Communications of the ACM, 26, 6, pp. 430-444, (1983); Kling, Iacono, Behind the terminal, (1983); Collingridge, The Social Control of Technology, (1980); Hedberg, Design processes in the five banks, The Impact of Systems Change in Organizations: Results and Conclusions from a Multinational Study of Information Systems Development in Banks, (1979)","","","","","","","","","03085961","","TEPOD","","English","Telecommun Policy","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0021439961"

Interviews with 36 board chairs and general secretaries in social hybrids in Sweden show that while boards support social impact measurements, they face obstacles in implementing them. Drawing on the institutional logics framework, we identify three main reasons for these implementation problems. First, amid field level regulations focusing on cost efficiency, boards find it difficult to switch to a social impact that lacks a single metric that can be measured annually. Second, board members struggle to find sufficient time when they serve on a pro bono basis, and it is difficult to hold them accountable when limited progress occurs. Finally, acknowledging board practice variation, we highlight the need to distinguish between “beneficiary-driven” and “membership-driven” social hybrids. In the former, boards face the challenge of operationalizing the long-term benefits for end beneficiaries; in the latter, interactions with members are so operationally focused that boards struggle to maintain a long-term agenda for implementing social impact measurement. Given these challenges, we propose that future research should explicitly incorporate the board level in theorizing how hybrid organizations manage institutional logics and performance measurement. © 2024 The Authors","Board of directors; Hybrid board governance; Hybrid organizations; Institutional logic; Performance measurement; Social impact","","","","","","","","Ahrens T., Ferry L., Khalifa R., The critical potential of institutional theory revisited — a field study of the rationalisation of budget fairness through agentic actorhood, Qualitative Research in Accounting and Management, 20, 5, pp. 593-620, (2023); Ahrne G., Brunsson N., Organizations and meta-organizations, Scandinavian Journal of Management, 21, 4, pp. 429-449, (2005); Amis J., Barney J., Mahoney J.T., Wang H., From the editors—why we need a theory of stakeholder governance—and why this is a hard problem, Academy of Management Review, 45, 3, pp. 499-503, (2020); Andon P., Baxter J., Chua W.F., Accounting change as relational drifting: A field study of experiments with performance measurement, Management Accounting Research, 18, 2, pp. 273-308, (2007); Banerjee A., Nordqvist M., Hellerstedt K., The role of the board chair—a literature review and suggestions for future research, Corporate Governance: An International Review, 28, 6, pp. 372-405, (2020); Barman E., Hall M., Millo Y., Demonstrating value: How entrepreneurs design new accounting methods to justify innovations, European Accounting Review, 30, 4, pp. 675-704, (2021); Battilana J., Besharov M., Mitzinneck B., On hybrids and hybrid organizing: A review and roadmap for future research, The SAGE handbook of organizational institutionalism, 2, pp. 133-169, (2017); Battilana J., Dorado S., Building sustainable hybrid organizations: The case of commercial microfinance organizations, Academy of Management Journal, 53, 6, pp. 1419-1440, (2010); Battilana J., Lee M., Advancing research on hybrid organizing – insights from the study of social enterprises, The Academy of Management Annals, 8, 1, pp. 397-441, (2014); Battilana J., Obloj T., Pache A.-C., Sengul M., Beyond shareholder value maximization: Accounting for financial/social trade-offs in dual-purpose companies, Academy of Management Review, 47, 2, pp. 237-258, (2022); Battilana J., Sengul M., Pache A.-C., Model J., Harnessing productive tensions in hybrid organizations: The case of work integration social enterprises, Academy of Management Journal, 58, 6, pp. 1658-1685, (2015); Baxter J., Carlsson-Wall M., Chua W.F., Kraus K., Accounting and passionate interests: The case of a Swedish football club, Accounting, Organizations and Society, 74, pp. 21-40, (2019); Benet N., Deville A., Ventolini S., When a financially oriented performance measurement system supports hybrid collective sensemaking: The case of a cooperative bank, The British Accounting Review, (2023); Berkowitz H., Dumez H., The concept of meta-organization: Issues for management studies, European Management Review, 13, 2, pp. 149-156, (2016); Besharov M.L., Smith W.K., Multiple institutional logics in organizations: Explaining their varied nature and implications, Academy of Management Review, 39, 3, pp. 364-381, (2014); Bezemer P.J., Peij S.C., Maassen G.F., van Halder H., The changing role of the supervisory board chairman: The case of The Netherlands (1997–2007), Journal of Management & Governance, 16, 1, pp. 37-55, (2012); Bezemer P.J., Pugliese A., Nicholson G., Zattoni A., Toward a synthesis of the board-strategy relationship: A literature review and future research agenda, Corporate Governance: An International Review, 31, 1, pp. 178-197, (2023); Carlsson-Wall M., Kraus K., Messner M., Performance measurement systems and the enactment of different institutional logics: Insights from a football organization, Management Accounting Research, 32, pp. 45-61, (2016); Chaidali P., Cordery C., Dhanani A., Varoutsa E., Charity impact reporting: Informing the forthcoming SORP, (2022); Chartrand S., Work in voluntary welfare organizations : A sociological study of voluntary welfare organizations in Sweden.

This finding contradicts the predictions of institutional theory; external factors, such as legitimacy and isomorphism, should exert strong influences on nascent social enterprises’ behavior. Using the same dataset as that used in Lall's (2017) study, we find the missing influence of external factors, i.e., equity and grant funding-related behavior.

HSR has brought impacts which have been widely studied in different countries in relation to the different socioeconomic, territorial and transport characteristics. This paper analyses the economic growth, the transport accessibility and the social impacts observed in Italy after ten years of HSR operation, as well as the estimated impacts of the system completion. The Italian case study is of particular interest since along the 1,467 km of new high speed line (300 km/h), a combination of major cities distances and a unique HSR competitive market, producing prices reductions and more daily trains, brought a 200% increase of HSR demand (from 15 to 45 millions of passengers/year). Estimations results show that, on average, HSR in Italy contributed to a significant increase in transport accessibility (+32%) for the zones along the HSR network, while only marginal for the others (+6%). Impacts on the economic growth show that HSR has contributed to an extra growth of per capita GDP of + 2.6% in 10 years and would have contributed to a further increase of 3.6% if the final project scenario (HSR_N) would had been completed by 2018. Regional (horizontal) equity impacts were evaluated in terms of the Gini indexes variations with respect to the distribution of the transport accessibility. It results that HSR in Italy has decreased equity in terms of users’ travel time accessibility of 11%, increasing the differences between the zones served by HSR and those not. If the HSR_N scenario would have been completed equity indices would have increased of 29% with respect to the pre-HSR 2008 scenario, thus reducing regional inequalities in the country. Results show that the HSR project was a country-level “game changer” in Italy, suggesting that the wider economic benefits, the assumptions on market regulation, the effects on regional disparities and the compensatory measures should be included in the ex ante and ex post evaluation of similar projects. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Economic growth and accessibility; HSR impacts; Rail transport; Regional equity; Transport investments evaluation; Transportation planning","Italy; Commerce; Railroad plant and structures; Railroad transportation; Travel time; Compensatory measure; Competitive markets; Ex-post evaluations; Future perspectives; High - speed railways; Regional disparities; Transport characteristics; Wider economic benefits; accessibility; competition (economics); economic growth; high-speed train; price dynamics; railway transport; social impact assessment; transportation policy; travel demand; urban transport; Economic and social effects","","","","","","","Agbelie B.R.D.K., An empirical analysis of three econometric frameworks for evaluating economic impacts of transportation infrastructure expenditures across countries, Transp.

Several methods for ranking mutual funds based on financial performance have been developed; nonetheless, ranking based on non-financial performance is rather underdeveloped. The aim of this article is to present a ranking method for mutual funds, based on their socially responsible performance. The suggested ranking method could complement financial information and help socially responsible mutual fund managers, individual and institutional investors in their portfolio selection process. The results reveal, after comparing the rank obtained with the proposed method with rankings derived from other socially responsible measurements based on just one decision criterion, that an integrated framework using multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA) techniques could help the investor in selecting a suitable socially responsible mutual funds portfolio, because the consideration of several criteria reflect more precisely the multiple dimensions of this decision making problem.

However, they face significant challenges in effectively assessing their contribution to the SDGs. In our study, by adopting an action-research methodology, we develop and introduce Prosper, i.e., a tailored social impact assessment (SIA) framework for startups. First, we conducted a comprehensive review of existing methods and standards for assessing social impact to establish an initial foundation of Prosper. Second, we refined Prosper based on an empirical validation on five startups. By embracing action research, we aim to empower startups with a robust and user-friendly tool, which facilitates SIA and representation. We also contribute to the literature aimed at overcoming the existing sustainability barriers for startups and to respond to the call for assisting them in reporting about SDGs. We also discuss practical implications and future research avenues.  © The Author(s), 2024.

Current measurement tools and evaluation approaches are grounded in conventional accounting practices, and thus tend to a focus on the outcomes of products and services, mainly evaluating economic performance. This presents a particular challenge when it comes to evaluating the impacts of social innovation, which have intended effects beyond economic and financial. This paper describes conventional measurement tools and their limitations for evaluating social impact, and proposes that developmental evaluation is more suited to evaluating social innovation. The consequences of not developing new metrics for social innovation are discussed in terms of the disadvantages for decision-making. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","adaptive cycle; complex systems; developmental evaluation; Metrics for social innovation; resilience; social impact measurement","","","","","","","","Arvidson M., Lyon F., McKay S., Moro D., The ambitions and challenges of SROI [online], (2010); Berkes F., Colding J., Folke C., Navigating social-ecological systems: Building resilience for complexity and change, (2003); Bugg-Levine A., Emerson J., Impact investing: Transforming how we make money while making a difference, (2011); Bugg-Levine A., Kogut B., Kulatilaka N., A new approach to funding social enterprises: unbundling societal benefits and financial returns can dramatically increase investment, Harvard business review, 90, 1, pp. 119-123, (2012); Dolan P.H., Metcalfe R.M., The impact of subjective wellbeing on local authority interventions, (2008); Earl S., Carden F., Smutylo T., Outcome mapping: Building learning and reflection into development program [online], (2001); Ebrahim A., Rangan V.K., The limits of nonprofit impact: A contingency framework for measuring social performance [online], (2010); Emerson J., Wachowicz J., Chun S., Social return on investment: Exploring aspects of value creation in the nonprofit sector, (1999); Gamble J.A.A., A developmental evaluation primer [online], (2008); Geobey S., Westley F., Weber O., Enabling social innovation through developmental impact investing [online], (2011); Gervais M., Lessons from less-than-successful evaluation experiences.

We appraise the accessibility of different districts within the MMA in terms of the actual and perceived cost of using the road infrastructure 'before' and 'after' implementation of the scheme. The appraisal framework was developed using quantitative survey data and qualitative focus group discussions with residents. We then simulated user behaviours (mode and route choice) based on the empirical evidence from a travel demand model for the MMA. The results from our simulation model demonstrated that implementation of the toll on the orbital metropolitan motorways (M40, M30, for example) decreases accessibility mostly in the districts where there are no viable public transport alternatives.Our specific study finding is that the economic burden of the road-pricing scheme particularly affects unskilled and lower income individuals living in the south of the MMA. The focus groups confirmed that low income drivers in the south part of the MMA would reduce their use of tolled roads and have to find new arrangements for these trips: i.e. switch to public transport, spend double the time travelling or stay at home. More generally, our research finds that European transport planners are still a long way from recognising the social equity implications of their policy decisions and that more thorough social appraisals are needed to avoid the social exclusion of low income populations when road tolling is proposed. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Madrid; Road pricing; Social equity; Spatial equity; Urban context","Madrid [Madrid (ADS/PRV)]; Madrid [Madrid (ADS/PRV)]; Madrid [Spain]; Spain; accessibility; equity; equity; low income population; low income population; metropolitan area; policy implementation; public transport; road pricing; road pricing; social exclusion; social impact; social impact assessment; survey method; transportation infrastructure; transportation planning; transportation policy; travel behavior; urban planning; urban transport","","","","","European Corporation in Science and Technology; Economic and Social Research Council, ESRC, (ES/J00023X/1, ES/J00023X/2)","The authors express their gratitude to two anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments that contributed to improving an earlier version of this paper.

However, there are limited research and model that create a platform for teenagers and youths to acquire leadership and entrepreneurial skills in public high schools. Previous work has only focused on students in tertiary institutions. In response to the need and to produce youths with entrepreneurial, leadership skills, competent and resilience, this paper investigates the impact of leadership and entrepreneurship education as a strategy for strengthening youth community engagement in Nigeria, lesson learnt from Jumpstart Project. The study adopted the theory of social impact assessment. The respondents are the final year and alumni scholars of the project. A qualitative design method was used. An interview was conducted containing some questions under these sub-themes the accessibility, types, relevant, how they utilized the skills learnt and the challenges faced during the project. An analysis from the responses indicated that leadership and entrepreneurial education is highly important for students in high schools where the students can align their education pursuit with leadership and entrepreneurial skills. However, there is a lot that is expected of them in order to meet up with the school curriculum. Furthermore, this study found a correlation between entrepreneurial and leadership education and academic excellence. The study recommends that such a model should be adopted into the curriculum, where all government-owned high school students learn the art of leadership and develop the entrepreneurial spirit even as a teenager. © 2019, Allied Business Academies.

This paper contends that there are serious limitations involved in RPS approaches when employed as a stand-alone SIA method, which throw doubt on whether the results obtained from these surveys in fact indicate actual impacts from tourism at all. While it is not disputed that the RPS approach can be an important SIA tool, it is argued that RPS results-if they are to be accepted as valid measures of social impacts-need to be supplemented by other research data, such as that obtained from visitor surveys, participant observation, in-depth interviews and, of particular focus in this paper, quantitative social indicator research. An integrated approach is recommended that aims to determine whether the impacts indicated in RPS results derive from tourism development or are caused by external factors, including factors that may well be 'imaginary' in nature. Hence, a combined approach attempts to triangulate the causal variables underlying the perceived impacts. The importance of undertaking such triangulation is not only to further understanding of the effects of tourism development on host communities, but to ensure that the incorporation of resident attitudes into tourism planning is undertaken in an informed manner that will benefit all concerned. © 2005 Tourism Recreation Research.","Methodology; Resident perceptions; Social impact; Social indicator; Tourism impact; Triangulation","","","","","","","","Allen L., Beattie R.R., The Role of Leisure as an Indicator of Overall Satisfaction with Community Life, Journal of Leisure Research, 16, pp. 99-109, (1984); Ap J., Residents' Perceptions Research on the Social Impacts of Tourism, Annals of Tourism Research, 17, pp. 610-616, (1990); Ap J., Residents' Perceptions on Tourism Impacts, Annals of Tourism Research, 19, pp. 665-690, (1992); Ap J., Crompton J.L., Developing and Testing a Tourism Impact Scale, Journal of Travel Research, 37, 2, pp. 120-130, (1998); Baines J., McClintock W., Taylor N., Buckenham B., Conceptual and Methodological Advances in Social Impact Assessment, The International Handbook of Social Impact Assessment, pp. 26-41, (2003); Barrow C.J., Social Impact Assessment: An Introduction, (2000); Berger P.L., Luckmann T., The Social Construction of Reality, (1967); Brougham J., Butler F.R.W., A Segmentation Analysis of Resident Attitudes to the Social Impact of Tourism, Annals Oftourism Research, 8, pp. 569-590, (1981); Brunt P., Courtney P., Host Perceptions of Sociocultural Impacts, Annals Oftourism Research, 26, 3, pp. 493-515, (1999); Burdge R., Vanclay F., Social Impact Assessment, Environmental and Social Impact Assessment, (1995); Butler R.W., The Concept of a Tourist Area Cycle of Evolution: Implications for the Management of Resources, Canadian Geographer, 24, pp. 5-12, (1980); Campbell J., Participatory Rural Appraisal as Qualitative Research: Distinguishing Methodological Issues from Participatory Claims, Human Organization, 60, 4, pp. 380-390, (2001); Carley M., Social Measurement and Social Indicators: Issues of Policy and Theory, (1981); Casado-Diaz M.A., Socio-demographic Impacts of Residential Tourism: A Case Study of Torrevieja, Spain, International Journal of Tourism Research, 1, pp. 223-237, (1999); Cegielski M., Mules T., Aspects of Residents' Perceptions of the GMC 400-Canberra's VB Supercar Race, Current Issuesin Tourism, 5, 1, pp. 54-70, (2002); Delamere T.A., Development of Scale Items to Measure the Social Impact of Community Festivals, Journal of Applied Recreation Research, 22, 4, pp. 293-315, (1997); Delamere T.A., Development of a Scale to Measure Resident Attitudes Toward the Social Impacts of Community Festivals part 2: Verification of the scale, Event Management, 7, 1, pp. 25-38, (2001); Delamere T.A., Wankel L.M., Hinch T.D., Development of Scale to Measure Resident Attitudes Toward the Social Impacts of Community Festivals part 1: Item Generation and Purification of the Measure, Event Management, 7, 1, pp. 11-24, (2001); Denzin N.K., The Research Act: A Theoretical Introduction to Sociological Methods, (1970); Doxey G.V., A Causation Theory of Visitor-resident Irritants: Methodology and Research Inferences, Proceedings of the Travel Research Association, 6Th Annual Conference, (1975); Easterby-Smith M., Thorpe R., Low A., Management Research: An Introduction, (1991); Faulkner B., Tideswell C., A Framework for Monitoring Community Impacts of Tourism, Journal of Sustainable Tourism, 5, 1, pp. 3-28, (1997); Fredline E., Faulkner B., Variations in Residents' Reactions to Major Motorsport Events: Why Residents Perceive the Impacts of Events Differently, Event Management, 7, pp. 115-125, (2002); Fredline L., Social Impacts of Tourism on the Gold Coast, (2002); Fredline L., Jago L., Deery M., The Development of a Generic Scale to Measure the Social Impacts of Events, Event Management, 8, pp. 23-37, (2003); Getz D., Residents' Attitudes Towards Tourism, Tourism Management, 15, 4, pp. 247-258, (1994); Hall M., Page S., The Geography of Tourism and Recreation: Environment, Place and Space, (1999); Haralambopoulos N., Pizam A., Percieved Impacts of Tourism: The Case of Samos, Annals Oftourism Research, 23, 3, pp. 503-526, (1996); Lankford K., Howard R., Developing a Tourism Impact Attitude Scale.

A link exists between paradigms and theories and policies and consequently the practices humans develop to tackle real world problems. I also argue that different types of thinking (contained in paradigms and theories) need to be integrated, at least at the scientific level, to enhance our understanding of social phenomena. This in turn can have a positive influence on policy processes that follow impact assessment recommendations. I am not arguing for the adoption of theoretical positions by practitioners, Instead, I contend that if impact assessments are informed by a variety of paradigms and theories, the policy practitioner might have a better understanding of the issue and the moral choices he or she needs to make. I will highlight the connection between theory and policies with practical examples from the social impact assessment of the De Hoop Dam, which was constructed on the Steelpoort River. I also argue for an integration of different theories to give a deeper understanding of real world problems. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","De Hoop Dam; Impact assessment; Practice; Steelpoort River; Theory","Environmental Policy; Ethics, Professional; Humans; Rivers; Social Theory; environmental policy; human; medical ethics; river; sociological theory","","","","","Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, India, CSIR","Ms Engela van Heerden, the Subject Librarian at the CSIR, is acknowledged for her assistance in sourcing some of the material as well as supplying the abbreviations for the journals.

First, a much-neglected issue in project management is identified, namely that the front-end estimates of costs and benefits - used in the business cases, cost-benefit analyses, and social and environmental impact assessments that typically support decisions on projects - are commonly significantly different from actual ex post costs and benefits, and are therefore poor predictors of the actual value and viability of projects. Second, it is discussed how Kahneman and Tversky's theories of the planning fallacy and the outside view may help explain and remedy this situation through quality control of decisions. Third, it is described what quality control and due diligence are in the context of project management, and an eight-step procedure is outlined for due diligence based on the outside view. Fourth, the procedure is tested on a real-life, multibillion-dollar project, organized as a public-private partnership. Finally, Akerlof and Shiller's recent discussion in economics of ""firing the forecaster"" is discussed together with its relevance to project management. In sum, the paper demonstrates the need, the theoretical basis, a practical methodology, and a real-life example for how to de-bias project management using quality control and due diligence based on the outside view. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd and IPMA.","Cost-benefit analysis; Daniel Kahneman; Due diligence; Ex-post analysis; Forecasting; Front-end management; Outside view; Planning fallacy; Quality control","Cost benefit analysis; Cost effectiveness; Forecasting; Quality assurance; Quality control; Risk assessment; Business case; Costs and benefits; Daniel Kahneman; Due diligence; Ex-post analysis; Outside view; Public private partnerships; Social and environmental impact; business; cost-benefit analysis; decision making; environmental impact assessment; planning theory; project management; public-private partnership; quality control; social impact assessment; Project management","","","","","","","Akerlof G.A., Shiller R.J., Animal Spirits: How Human Psychology Drives the Economy, and Why It Matters for Global Capitalism, (2009); JAPA article calls on planners to help end inaccuracies in public project revenue forecasting; Arena M.V., Leonard R.S., Murray S.E., Younossi O., Historical Cost Growth of Completed Weapon System Programs, (2006); Bainbridge S.M., The Complete Guide to Sarbanes-Oxley, (2007); Bing G., Due Diligence: Planning, Questions, Issues, (2007); Bradley M., A Comparison of Australian Airport Rail Links With Systems Elsewhere in the World, Paper presented at the Australian Transport Research Forum, Sydney, September 28-30, (2005); Breakwell G.M., The Psychology of Risk, (2007); Budzier A., Flyvbjerg B., Double Whammy: How ICT Projects are Fooled by Randomness and Screwed by Political Intent, Working Paper, Saïd Business School, University of Oxford, (2011); Buehler R., Griffin D., Ross M., Exploring the ""planning fallacy"": why people underestimate their task completion times, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 67, pp. 366-381, (1994); Cantarelli C.C., Flyvbjerg B., van Wee B., Molin E.J.E., Lock-in and its influence on the project performance of large-scale transportation infrastructure projects: investigating the way in which lock-in can emerge and affect cost overruns, Environment and Planning B: Planning and Design, 37, pp. 792-807, (2010); Chapman C.E., Conducting Due Diligence, (2006); Ny anlægsbudgettering på Transportministeriets område, herunder om økonomistyringsmodel og risikohåndtering for anlægsprojekter, New Construction Budgeting for The Ministry of Transport, Including Financial Management Model and Risk Management for Construction Projects, (2008); Dantata N.A., Touran A., Schneck D.C., Trends in US Rail Transit Project Cost Overrun, Transportation Research Board Annual Meeting, (2006); De Meyer, Loch C.H., Pich M.T., Managing Project Uncertainty: from Variation to Chaos, Sloan Management Review, pp. 59-67, (2002); Edkins A., Geraldi J., Morris P., Smith A., Exploring the Front-end of Project Management, Proceedings of the Engineering Project Organizations Conference, Rheden, The Netherlands, (2012); Fischoff B., Heuristics and Biases in Application, Heuristics and Biases: The Psychology of Intuitive Judgment, (2002); Flyvbjerg B., Measuring inaccuracy in travel demand forecasting: methodological considerations regarding ramp up and sampling, Transportation Research A, 39, 6, pp. 522-530, (2005); Flyvbjerg B., From Nobel Prize to Project Management: Getting Risks Right, Project Management Journal, 37, 3, pp. 5-15, (2006); Flyvbjerg B., Policy and planning for large-infrastructure projects: problems, causes, cures, Environment and Planning B: Planning and Design, 34, 4, pp. 578-597, (2007); Flyvbjerg B., Cost overruns and demand shortfalls in urban rail and other infrastructure, Transportation Planning and Technology, 30, 1, pp. 9-30, (2007); Flyvbjerg B., Survival of the unfittest: why the worst infrastructure gets built, and what we can do about it, Oxford Review of Economic Policy, 25, 3, pp. 344-367, (2009); Flyvbjerg B., Budzier A., Why your IT project may be riskier than you think, Harvard Business Review, pp. 601-603, (2011); Flyvbjerg B., Cowi Procedures for Dealing with Optimism Bias in Transport Planning: Guidance Document, (2004); Flyvbjerg B., Stewart A., Olympic Proportions: Cost and Cost Overrun at the Olympics 1960-2012, Working Paper, Saïd Business School, University of Oxford, (2012); Flyvbjerg B., Holm M.K.S., Buhl S.L., Underestimating costs in public works projects: error or lie?, Journal of the American Planning Association, 68, 3, pp. 279-295, (2002); Flyvbjerg B., Holm M.K.S., Buhl S.L., How (in)accurate are demand forecasts in public works projects?

It shows how individual resident perceptions can be included within social impact assessment through the use of psychological methods and discusses the relative merits of using personal construct theory -based repertory grids. Ten repertory grid interviews were completed in Eden, New South Wales, Australia. The findings present both the resulting repertory grids and a more detailed discussion of the interpretation of the grids through two narratives that focus on residents considering what, in their opinion, constitutes a sustainable utilisation of local forest land. The discussion examines how the results of this type of analysis can be used to understand individual residents' decisions to support or reject nature-based tourism proposals in favour of traditional extractive forest-industry sectors. It shows how this assessment system could aid planners in reconciling stakeholder conflict over the ideal usage of public forest land by offering a structured means of giving heterogeneous rural communities a formal voice in tourism-planning processes. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","community conflict; nature-based tourism; personal construct theory; repertory grid analysis","Australia; Eden; New South Wales; conservation planning; decision support system; ecotourism; forest management; nature conservation; perception; rural area; social conflict; social impact assessment; stakeholder; sustainable forestry","","","","","","","Adams J., Interrogating the equity principle: The rhetoric and reality of management planning for sustainable archaeological heritage tourism, Journal of Heritage Tourism,, 5, 2, pp. 103-123, (2010); Adams-Webber J., Personal construct theory: Concepts and applications, (1979); Ajani J., The forest wars, (2007); Allendorf T., Smith J., Anderson D., Residents' perceptions of Royal Bardia National Park, Nepal, Landscape and Urban Planning,, 82, 1-2, pp. 33-40, (2007); Ap J., Residents' perceptions on tourism impacts, Annals of Tourism Research,, 19, 4, pp. 665-690, (1992); Barlow K., Cocklin C., Reconstructing rurality and community: Plantation forestry in Victoria, Australia, Journal of Rural Studies,, 19, pp. 503-519, (2003); Barraket J., Building sustainable communities: Co-operative solutions to rural renewal, (2001); Barrow C., Environmental and social impact assessment: An introduction, (1997); Bartlett T., Regional forest agreements - A policy, legislative and planning framework to achieve sustainable forest management in Australia, Environmental and Planning Law Journal,, 16, 4, pp. 328-338, (1999); Beail N., Fisher K., Two component solutions of repertory grid data: A comparison of three methods, International Journal of Personal Construct Psychology,, 1, pp. 369-374, (1988); Beckley T., The relative importance of sociocultural and ecological factors in attachment to place.

Semi-structured interviews were conducted with volunteer tourists on perceived impacts on favela (slum) communities of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. This study was developed to address a need for further research that critically looks at the social impacts of volunteer tourism in marginalized communities. It addresses the following question: How does volunteer tourism influence a marginalized community from the perspective of the volunteers? Notably, the majority of the volunteers in this study had difficulty describing how volunteer tourism has benefited the community beyond their own individual contributions, and it was difficult for them to see broader implications of volunteer tourism in general. Recommendations of management actions that will help to maintain and enhance the benefits and alleviate the negative consequences and obstacles that were perceived by volunteer tourists are given. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","community impacts; marginalized communities; slum; social representations theory; Volunteer tourism","Brazil; Rio de Janeiro [Brazil]; Rio de Janeiro [Rio de Janeiro (STT)]; community response; perception; social impact assessment; tourism development; tourist behavior; voluntary approach","","","","","","","Alves M.H.M., Evanson P., Living in the crossfire: Favela residents, drug dealers, and police violence in Rio de Janeiro, (2011); Aquino J., Andereck K., (2011); Barbieri C., Santos C.A., Katsube Y., Volunteer tourism: On-the-ground observations from Rwanda, Tourism Management, 33, 3, pp. 509-516, (2012); Bargeman B., Richards G., Govers E., Volunteer tourism impacts in Ghana: a practice approach, Current Issues in Tourism, 21, 13, pp. 1486-1501, (2018); Bauer I., More harm than good?

However, flooding does not impact all individuals equally. Therefore, understanding how flooding impacts distribute across populations of different socioeconomic and demographic backgrounds is vital. One approach to reducing flood risk on people is using indicators, such as social vulnerability indices and flood exposure metrics, to inform decision-making for flood risk management. However, such indicators can face the scale and zonal effect produced by the Modifiable Areal Unit Problem (MAUP). This study investigates how the U.S. Census block group, tract, and county scale selection impacts social vulnerability and flood exposure outcomes within coastal Virginia, USA. Here we show how (1) scale selection can obstruct our understanding of drivers of vulnerability, (2) increasingly aggregated scales significantly undercount highly vulnerable populations, and (3) hotspot clusters of social vulnerability and flood exposure can identify variable priority areas for current and future flood risk reduction. Study results present considerations about using such indicators, given the real-life consequences that can occur due to the MAUP. The results of this work warrant understanding the implications of scale selection on research methodological approaches and what this means for practitioners and policymakers that utilize such information to help guide flood mitigation strategies. © 2023","Flood exposure; Flooding; Index; Indicators; MAUP; Modifiable areal unit problem; Natural hazard; Scale; Social equity; Social vulnerability; SOVI","United States; Virginia; climate change; climate effect; coastal zone; environmental factor; flood control; flood damage; flood frequency; flooding; hypothesis testing; land use change; mitigation; natural hazard; policy making; risk assessment; social impact assessment; socioeconomic impact; strategic approach; vulnerability","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (1941657, 2244715); George Washington University, GW; Pennsylvania State University, PSU","Funding text 1: Partial funding to support Selena Hinojos was provided by the National Science Foundation (NSF) under grant # 1941657 and # 2244715 .

Due to this, assessing the social impacts of additive manufacturing technology is crucial. The assessment process to determine the social impacts of additive manufacturing information from factors, which are qualitative, incomplete, and uncertain in nature, is observed. The evidential reasoning (ER) approach is a method that can handle subjective, uncertain, and incomplete data. In this paper, the ER approach along with the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) is incorporated for the first time to build up a model for assessing the social impacts of additive manufacturing technology. Based on the experts’ opinion, AHP is applied to the relevant attributes of social impacts to rate and structure the attributes. In this research, the model will be tested using subjective judgmental belief structure data. The data will be aggregated using the ER approach and the attributes will be illustrated in a distributed manner. In the proposed model, Yager’s combination method is applied to compare the output of the D–S approach. The model output is comprised of the average state of social impact from additive manufacturing along with a level of uncertainty for each attribute. The proposed model is now available for utilization by the decision maker to assess the social impacts of additive manufacturing technology. Furthermore, the model could be used as a baseline for planning mitigation of impacts to or improvement to a current state of social impacts. © 2022, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Global Institute of Flexible Systems Management.","Additive manufacturing; Data fusion; Dempster–Shafer (D–S) theory; Hierarchical evidential reasoning; Risk management; Social impacts assessment; Uncertainty modeling","","","","","","","","Ahmadzadeh F., Bengtsson M., Using evidential reasoning approach for prioritization of maintenance-related waste caused by human factors—A case study, International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology, 90, 9-12, pp. 2761-2775, (2017); Attaran M., The rise of 3-D printing: The advantages of additive manufacturing over traditional manufacturing, Business Horizons, 60, 5, pp. 677-688, (2017); Bappy M.M., Ali S.M., Kabir G., Paul S.K., Supply chain sustainability assessment with Dempster–Shafer evidence theory: Implications in cleaner production, Journal of Cleaner Production, 237, (2019); Birtchnell T., Hoyle W., 3D printing for development in the global south: The 3D4D challenge, 3D Printing for Development in The Global South: The 3D4D Challenge, (2014); Bonilla-Alicea R.J., Fu K., Systematic map of the social impact assessment field, Sustainability (Switzerland), (2019); Campbell I., Bourell D., Gibson I., Additive manufacturing: Rapid prototyping comes of age, Rapid Prototyping Journal, 18, 4, pp. 255-258, (2012); Chen D., Heyer S., Ibbotson S., Salonitis K., Steingrimsson J.G., Thiede S., Direct digital manufacturing: Definition, evolution, and sustainability implications, Journal of Cleaner Production, 107, pp. 615-625, (2015); Contador J.C., Satyro W.C., Contador J.L., Spinola M.D.M., Flexibility in the Brazilian industry 4.0: Challenges and opportunities, Global Journal of Flexible Systems Management, 21, pp. 15-31, (2020); Dempster A.P., Upper and lower probabilities induced by a multivalued Mapping, The Annals of Mathematical Statistics, 38, 2, pp. 325-339, (1967); Diegel O., Singamneni S., Reay S., Withell A., Tools for sustainable product design: Additive manufacturing, Journal of Sustainable Development, (2010); Dwivedi A., Agrawal D., Jha A., Gastaldi M., Paul S.K., D'Adamo I., Addressing the challenges to sustainable initiatives in value chain flexibility: Implications for sustainable development goals, Global Journal of Flexible Systems Management, 22, 2, pp. 179-197, (2021); Elkington J., Cannibals with Forks: The Triple Bottom Line of 21St Century Business.

Due to various sustainability issues significantly relevant to farm tourism, a holistic evaluation of farm tourism sites must be carried out. Thus, this study proposes an integrated fuzzy Delphi, fuzzy best-worst method (BWM), and fuzzy simple additive weighting (SAW) methodological framework to generate a composite sustainability index evaluation of farm tourism sites. The proposed approach adopts an inclusive indicator-based system primarily used in sustainability performance evaluation. This framework was applied in the case of an organic farm tourism site. It was performed in three primary steps: (1) the fuzzy Delphi approach was used to establish a relevant set of sustainable farm tourism indicators from a set of sustainable ecotourism indicators previously reported in the literature, (2) the fuzzy BWM was then used to generate the weights of the established indicators, and (3) the fuzzy SAW method was used to obtain a single-valued composite sustainability score. The integrated methodological framework offered in this work generates a single-valued score representing the sustainability status of farm tourism sites that can aid planning and decision-making. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","best-worst method; Delphi; farm tourism; fuzzy set theory; simple additive weighting; Sustainability","composite; fuzzy mathematics; social impact assessment; sustainability; tourism","","","","","DOT Regional Office 7; Department of Tourism; National Office of the Department of Tourism","Funding text 1: This work was supported by the Department of Tourism - Tourism Research Grant (DOT-TRG) 2018 of the Republic of the Philippines through a funded project entitled “Indicator-based sustainability evaluation of farm tourism sites in Central Visayas”.
